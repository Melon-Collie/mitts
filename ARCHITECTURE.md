## Design Philosophy

Depth over breadth — few inputs with rich emergent behavior rather than many explicit mechanics.

The Rocket League freeplay ceiling is a guiding star: the stickhandling-to-shot pipeline should reward practice and feel satisfying to master.

**Key inspirations:** Omega Strikers / Rocket League (structure), Breakpoint (twin-stick melee blade feel), Mario Superstar Baseball (stylized characters, exaggerated tuning, pre-match draft). Slapshot: Rebound is a cautionary reference — pure physics shooting feels unintuitive; the blade proximity pickup system is explicitly designed to solve that accessibility gap.

---

## Layers

The codebase is organized into three layers with downward dependency flow.

**Domain** (`Scripts/domain/`) — pure GDScript, zero engine references. Comprises:
- Rule classes as `class_name` files with static methods (`PhaseRules`, `PlayerRules`, `InfractionRules`, `PuckCollisionRules`, `SkaterMovementRules`, `ShotMechanics`, `GoalieBehaviorRules`, `ChargeTracking`, `ReconciliationRules`)
- `GameStateMachine` — a `RefCounted` owning phase/timer, scores, player slot registry, icing state, ghost computation. Lives on both host and client; the host drives it via `tick()`, clients sync via `apply_remote_state()`.
- `GameRules` const class for timings/geometry/thresholds
- `GamePhase` enum

All of this is unit-tested with GUT. ~130 tests under `tests/unit/rules/` and `tests/unit/state/`.

**Application** — `GameManager` (autoload), controllers, `ActorSpawner`. Consumes the domain to make decisions, reaches into infrastructure to execute them. Controllers receive a `game_state: Node` (the GameManager itself, duck-typed) via `setup()` rather than reaching for `GameManager.*` statically.

**Infrastructure** — actor nodes (Skater, Puck, Goalie), `NetworkManager`, UI. Engine integration. Lower layers never reach up:
- `Puck` accepts a `team_resolver: Callable` via `set_team_resolver()` — used by the poke-check eligibility gate without referencing `GameManager`.
- `PuckController` accepts a `peer_id_resolver: Callable` and emits `puck_picked_up_by(peer_id)` / `puck_released_by_carrier(peer_id)` / `puck_stripped_from(peer_id)` signals that `GameManager` listens to for player-registry lookups and RPC sends.
- Controllers take a `game_state: Node` with `is_host() -> bool` and `is_movement_locked() -> bool`.

Adding a new rule: put pure math in a `domain/rules/` file, write a GUT test for it, call it from the controller/GameManager.

## Scene Structure

- **Skater:** `CharacterBody3D` with UpperBody/LowerBody split (`Node3D`). Shoulder (`Marker3D`) under UpperBody, positioned by code based on handedness. Blade (`Marker3D`) and StickMesh under UpperBody. `set_blade_position` rotates the Blade node to face along the shaft (horizontal projection of shoulder→blade), so the BladeArea and mesh always track stick angle. `blade_world_velocity` and `is_elevated` are tracked each physics tick for server-side puck interaction queries. Collision layers set in `_ready()`: body on `LAYER_SKATER_BODIES` (16), mask `MASK_SKATER` (17), stick raycast mask `MASK_SKATER` so the blade is blocked by boards, goalie pads, and other skater bodies. A `BodyBlockArea` (sphere, `collision_mask = LAYER_PUCK`) is added as a child and wired to the `body_block_hit` signal.
- **Puck:** `RigidBody3D` with cylinder collision (radius 0.1m, height 0.05m). PickupZone (`Area3D`, `SphereShape3D` radius 0.5m) for blade proximity detection. Emits `puck_picked_up`, `puck_released`, and `puck_stripped` signals. Physics runs server-side only — frozen on clients. Per-skater cooldown timers (`_cooldown_timers: Dictionary`) replace the old global timer so two players can race a loose puck independently.
- **Rink:** `StaticBody3D` with procedurally generated walls, corners, and ice surface via `@tool` script. 60×26m, Z axis is the long axis.
- **Goals:** `StaticBody3D` with procedurally generated Art Ross net via `@tool` script. Two cubic Bézier curves (base at Y=0, top shelf at Y=1.22m) define the frame shape — the base flares wider than the posts, the top shelf curves inward. Frame tubes are box segments swept along the curves (base = white, top shelf + posts + crossbar = red). Netting is a ruled surface `ArrayMesh` connecting corresponding points on the two curves, with a `ConcavePolygonShape3D` for accurate puck collision. Posts and crossbar use `CylinderMesh` + `CylinderShape3D`. A solid `BoxShape3D` back wall sits at ~1.0m depth to cover seam gaps in the ConcavePolygonShape3D. The goal sensor `Area3D` validates entry direction — `puck.linear_velocity.dot(facing_z) > 0` — so only pucks entering from the rink side can score.
- **Goalie:** `Node3D` root (`goalie.gd`) with seven `StaticBody3D` body parts (LeftPad, RightPad, Body, Head, Glove, Blocker, Stick). A sibling `GoalieController` node drives positioning. Body part positions and rotations lerp between per-state configs (`GoalieBodyConfig`) each frame. Part sizes: pads 0.28×0.84×0.15, body 0.40×0.60×0.25, head 0.22×0.22×0.20, glove 0.25×0.25×0.15, blocker 0.20×0.30×0.10, stick 0.50×0.04×0.04. The Stick is disabled by default (`@export stick_enabled: bool = false`); `_ready()` zeroes its collision layer and hides it. In RVH the goalie root positions so the post pad outer edge is flush with the post (`net_half_width - 0.88`); left/right state selection uses goalie-local X (`direction_sign`) so both goalies behave correctly despite opposite world rotations.
- **Camera:** `Camera3D` per player. Weighted anchor system — player, puck, mouse, attacking goal. Zoom computed after position clamping.

## Collision Layers

All layer/mask values are defined as named constants in `constants.gd`.

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `LAYER_WALLS` | 1 | Boards, ice surface, goalie body parts |
| `LAYER_BLADE_AREAS` | 2 | Skater blade `Area3D`s |
| `LAYER_PUCK` | 8 | Puck `RigidBody3D` — goal sensor `Area3D`s use `collision_mask = 8` to detect it |
| `LAYER_SKATER_BODIES` | 16 | Skater `CharacterBody3D` bodies |

Composed masks:

| Constant | Value | Used by |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `MASK_PUCK` | 1 | Puck bounces off walls + goalie bodies only — not skater bodies |
| `MASK_SKATER` | 17 | Skaters blocked by walls (1) + other skater bodies (16) |

The puck's pickup zone `Area3D` sits on `LAYER_WALLS \| LAYER_BLADE_AREAS` (3) with `collision_mask = LAYER_BLADE_AREAS` (2) so it detects blade `Area3D`s via `area_entered`.

---

## Networking

### Launch Modes

All paths go through `MainMenu.tscn`. `NetworkManager._ready()` is a no-op. The menu calls `start_offline()`, `start_host()`, or `start_client(ip)` — these configure ENet and set `is_host` but do not spawn the world. World spawn is deferred: `Hockey.tscn`'s root runs `game_scene.gd`, whose `_ready()` calls `NetworkManager.on_game_scene_ready()` → `GameManager.on_host_started()`. Clients spawn via `_on_connected_to_server()` as before.

Graceful shutdown: `_exit_tree` closes the ENet peer. Server disconnect on client side also triggers close.

### Model

Authoritative host. The host runs all physics. Clients predict locally and reconcile against server state. No dedicated server — one player hosts.

### Rates

| Channel | Rate | Transport |
|---------|------|-----------|
| Input (client → host) | 60 Hz | Unreliable |
| World state (host → clients) | 20 Hz | Unreliable |
| Events (pickup, spawn, sync) | On event | Reliable |

### Skater Networking

**LocalController** (local player on any machine):
- Runs full physics simulation locally every frame
- Stores input history (capped at 2 seconds)
- On world state receipt: filters confirmed inputs by `last_processed_sequence`, checks position/velocity error against threshold, resets to server state and replays unconfirmed inputs if correction is needed. Reset includes `position`, `velocity`, `facing`, `_facing` (controller copy), `_upper_body_angle`, and `skater.upper_body_rotation` — all must match server state before replay or blade position drifts during the replay.

**RemoteController** (other players):
- On the host: drives simulation from latest received input at 240 Hz
- On clients: buffers incoming `SkaterNetworkState` snapshots with timestamps, interpolates with a 100ms delay

### Puck Networking

**PuckController** manages three client-side modes:

1. **Local carrier** — when `_carrier_peer_id` matches local peer ID, the puck is pinned to the local blade position each frame. Zero lag, prediction only, no interpolation.
2. **Trajectory prediction** — after local release, the puck is unfrozen (`freeze = false`) and Jolt runs client-side physics, matching the server's simulation for static geometry (boards, goals). Each 20Hz server broadcast calls `_reconcile`: soft-corrects velocity toward server state via `velocity_correction_blend`; nudges position toward server only when `current_vel.dot(server_vel) > 0` (avoids fighting Jolt during bounces where velocities briefly oppose); hard-snaps both on extreme divergence (`prediction_reconcile_threshold`). Exits prediction when world state `carrier_peer_id != -1`, then refreezes and returns to interpolation.
3. **Interpolation** — buffer server snapshots and interpolate with the same 100ms delay as skaters. Position only — velocity is not applied to the frozen body (`_apply_state_to_puck` is position-only).

**Carrier transitions:**
- Pickup: server detects via physics signal → reliable RPC to the specific client who picked up the puck → `on_puck_picked_up_network()` on their LocalController
- Release: client predicts immediately (state machine transitions, trajectory prediction begins) → reliable RPC to server to execute physics
- Poke check (strip): server detects opposing blade contact while `carrier != null` → clears carrier, launches puck via `_poke_check()` → `puck_stripped` signal → reliable RPC to victim client (`notify_puck_stolen`) → victim calls `on_puck_released_network()` + `notify_local_puck_dropped()` to clear carry state and drop back to interpolation

`_carrier_peer_id` on clients is managed exclusively by `notify_local_pickup()` / `notify_local_release()` in `PuckController`. It is intentionally never updated from world state — unreliable packet ordering would cause it to conflict with locally-predicted transitions.

### Goalie Networking

**GoalieController** AI runs on the host only. Clients receive goalie state via the world state broadcast and interpolate with a 100ms delay using a `BufferedGoalieState` buffer — the same pattern as remote skaters.

Serialized per goalie: position (x/z), rotation_y, state enum, five_hole_openness (5 elements). Clients reconstruct body part configs locally from the state enum and five_hole_openness, then snap body parts to the interpolated config each frame.

RVH triggers when `_is_puck_in_defensive_zone()` — either the puck is behind the goal line, or it is within `zone_post_z` of the goal line and the horizontal angle to the puck exceeds `rvh_early_angle` (default 60°). This matches the Buckley depth chart's "Defensive" corner zones, which extend slightly in front of the goal line at sharp angles.

**Tracking lag:** `GoalieController` maintains `_tracked_puck_position` that lerps toward the real puck at `tracking_speed` (default 6.0) each frame. All positioning logic — lateral target, depth, facing, and state transitions — reads from this tracked position rather than the real puck. `_on_puck_released` (shot detection) reads the real puck position and velocity so butterfly reactions stay accurate. `tracking_speed` is the master difficulty export: lower = more positional lag.

### Puck Interactions (server-side)

All puck contact logic runs on the host via `Area3D.area_entered` on the PickupZone:

- **Catch vs deflect:** relative velocity `(puck_vel - blade_world_vel).length()` against `deflect_min_speed`. Moving your blade backward with the puck reduces relative velocity → catch. Stationary blade hit by fast puck → deflect. Below `pickup_max_speed` always catches.
- **Deflect direction:** contact normal = `(puck_pos - blade_world_pos).normalized()` (billiard ball style). Physical reflection blended toward incoming direction via `deflect_blend`. If `skater.is_elevated`, outgoing direction is tilted upward by `deflect_elevation_angle`.
- **Poke check:** when any blade enters PickupZone while `carrier != null`, `_poke_check` strips the puck (no team gate — teammates can strip each other). Strip direction = `checker_blade_vel + carrier_blade_vel * poke_carrier_vel_blend` (or spatial direction as fallback). Ex-carrier gets `reattach_cooldown`; checker gets brief `poke_checker_cooldown`.
- **Body check strip:** `SkaterController._on_body_checked_player` (server only) calls `puck.on_body_check(checker, victim, force, direction)`. If `force = weight × approach_speed ≥ body_check_strip_threshold` and `victim == carrier`, `_body_check_strip` clears the carrier and launches the puck in the hit direction. Emits `puck_stripped` + `puck_released` — same notification path as poke check.
- **Passive body block:** each `Skater` has a `BodyBlockArea` (`Area3D`, `collision_layer = 0`, `collision_mask = LAYER_PUCK`, sphere radius `body_block_radius`). On `body_entered`, Skater emits `body_block_hit`; `SkaterController._on_body_block_hit` (server only) calls `puck.on_body_block(blocker)`. Only fires on loose pucks (`carrier == null`). Reflects puck off body-center contact normal, multiplies speed by `body_block_dampen`, sets brief pickup cooldown on the blocker.
- **Per-skater cooldowns:** `_cooldown_timers: Dictionary` (Skater → float). Cooldown only applies to loose-puck pickups/deflects, not to poke checks. Lets two players race a loose puck — only the ex-carrier has a disadvantage.

### Why Not Predict Pickup?

Pickup is detected server-side via physics collision. Two players can contest the same puck — the server arbitrates who wins. Predicting pickup locally and rolling it back on a contested play would feel worse than the single round-trip delay. Pickup prediction is explicitly out of scope.

---

## Input Architecture

All input flows through an `InputState` data object populated by `LocalInputGatherer`. The abstraction supports swapping to network input or AI input without touching game logic.

`LocalInputGatherer` accumulates `just_pressed` events between physics ticks so no inputs are dropped. Mouse world position is computed via ray-plane intersection at y=0.

`InputState` fields: `sequence`, `delta`, `move_vector`, `mouse_world_pos`, `shoot_pressed`, `shoot_held`, `slap_pressed`, `slap_held`, `facing_held`, `brake`, `elevation_up`, `elevation_down`.

---

## Skater State Machine

| State | Blade | Movement | Facing |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| `SKATING_WITHOUT_PUCK` | Follows mouse | Full | Follows movement |
| `SKATING_WITH_PUCK` | Follows mouse | Full | Follows movement |
| `WRISTER_AIM` | Follows mouse | Full | Locked |
| `SLAPPER_CHARGE_WITH_PUCK` | Fixed forehand | Glide only | Locked (upper body aims) |
| `SLAPPER_CHARGE_WITHOUT_PUCK` | Fixed forehand | Full | Continuous toward mouse |
| `FOLLOW_THROUGH` | Stored relative angle | Full | Follows movement |

---

## Blade Control

The blade originates from the stick-hand shoulder. Mouse distance maps to reach — further away = more extended. Clamped to a forehand/backhand arc in upper-body local space.

Pushing past the arc limit rotates the player's facing smoothly (`facing_drag_speed`), so extended mouse movement naturally rotates the whole body.

Upper body rotates independently to express the angle between facing and blade direction (`upper_body_twist_ratio = 0.5`).

Wall clamping: blade reach is shortened near boards. If squeeze exceeds `wall_squeeze_threshold`, the puck releases along the wall normal.

---

## Shooting

**Puck carry speed penalty:** While carrying the puck, `effective_max_speed = max_speed * puck_carry_speed_multiplier` (default 0.88). The speed cap only applies to the cap check, not to thrust — so the skater still accelerates normally but is capped lower, preserving feel while making skating with the puck meaningfully slower than without it.

**Quick shot:** Tap left click. Fires blade-direction at `quick_shot_power`. Low skill floor.

**Wrister:** Hold left click, sweep blade to charge (distance-based), release to fire. Direction variance check resets charge if blade changes direction > 45° — prevents charge farming.

**Slapshot (with puck):** Hold right click. Blade fixes forehand, skater glides, upper body aims within `slapper_aim_arc`. Time-based charge.

**One-timer:** Hold right click without puck. Full movement available. Puck arriving while charging auto-transitions to slapshot state with charge carried over.

**Elevation:** Scroll to toggle. Persists until changed.

---

## Physics

- **Engine:** Godot 4.6.2 with Jolt Physics
- 240 Hz physics tick (prevents tunneling at high puck speeds)
- CCD enabled on puck
- Puck mass 0.17 kg, radius 0.1 m
- `GameRules.ICE_FRICTION = 0.01` — used in puck trajectory prediction. The rink ice surface is a child `StaticBody3D` with `physics_material_override` set directly, so friction applies correctly.
- Puck velocity is clamped in `_integrate_forces()` (runs on all peers) so CCD always receives a sane speed. The `_physics_process()` cap is kept as a secondary check.

---

## Camera

One camera per player. Weighted anchor:

| Anchor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Player | 1.0 (non-negotiable) |
| Puck | 1.0 |
| Mouse world pos | 0.5 |
| Attacking goal | 0.3 |

Player-first guarantee: weighted target is clamped so player never exceeds `player_margin` from frame edge. Zoom computed after position clamping to prevent fighting. Soft rink clamp applied last.

---

## Game Flow

### Phase FSM

`GamePhase` is host-driven. Clients receive phase via reliable RPC on goal events and as a correction channel in every world state broadcast.

| Phase | Duration | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `PLAYING` | Until goal | Normal gameplay |
| `GOAL_SCORED` | 2s (`GOAL_PAUSE_DURATION`) | Dead puck, celebration freeze |
| `FACEOFF_PREP` | 0.5s (`FACEOFF_PREP_DURATION`) | Players teleport to dots, puck resets, goalies reset to crease |
| `FACEOFF` | Until pickup or 10s timeout | Puck live at center dot, waiting for a player to pick it up |

### Dead-Puck Enforcement

The `GameStateMachine` exposes `is_movement_locked()` — true during `GOAL_SCORED` and `FACEOFF_PREP`. `GameManager` re-exposes this as an instance method and is passed into each controller at `setup()` as the `game_state` dependency. Controllers call `_game_state.is_movement_locked()` every frame:
- `LocalController._physics_process`: zeros velocity, drains `_input_history`, skips input gathering and processing
- `RemoteController._drive_from_input`: still advances `_last_processed_sequence` (keeps reconcile bookkeeping current) but zeros velocity and skips `_process_input`
- `LocalController.reconcile`: returns early during locked phases — `on_faceoff_positions` (reliable RPC) is the authoritative source of faceoff positions

### Controller API

`GameManager` describes *what* it wants; controllers implement *how*:
- `controller.teleport_to(pos)` — sets position, zeros velocity. `LocalController` override also clears `_input_history`.
- `controller.on_puck_released_network()` — idempotent; safe to call without checking `has_puck` first.

### Teams and Goals

Two `Team` objects created at startup. Each owns a `defended_goal` (`HockeyGoal` instance), a `goalie_controller`, and a `score`. Two `HockeyGoal` instances in the scene (`facing=+1` and `facing=-1`). Each has a shallow `Area3D` goal sensor at its mouth; the host connects `goal_scored` signals in `_connect_goal_signals()`.

### Player Colors

The host generates a unique color per player at spawn time via `_generate_player_color(team_id)`. Team 0 uses warm reds (hue 340°–20°), team 1 uses cool blues (hue 200°–260°). The range is divided into equal slots — one per player (max 3 per team) — so same-team players always land in distinct thirds of the hue band, with a ±25% jitter within the slot for variety. Color is sent to joining clients via the `assign_player_slot` and `spawn_remote_skater` RPCs, and embedded in the `sync_existing_players` array for players already in the session. Stored in `PlayerRecord.color`; applied via `skater.set_player_color()` which sets `material_override` on the upper-body mesh and blade mesh.

### Host Reset

`GameManager.reset_game()` (host-only): zeroes both scores, emits `score_changed` on the host, sends a `notify_game_reset` reliable RPC to all clients (they zero scores and emit `score_changed`), then calls `_begin_faceoff_prep()` which handles puck/player/goalie reset and sends faceoff positions via the existing `notify_faceoff_positions` RPC. The HUD builds a "Reset" button in the top-right corner only when `NetworkManager.is_host`.

### Ghost Mechanic (Offsides + Icing)

Instead of stoppages, offsides and icing are enforced via a **ghost mode** — offending players become semi-transparent and lose all puck/player interaction (collision layers zeroed) while retaining full movement. This keeps play flowing without dead time.

**Offsides:** checked every physics tick on the host via `InfractionRules.is_offside(skater_z, team_id, puck_z, is_carrier)`. A skater is offside if they are in their team's offensive zone (past the attacking blue line at ±7.62m) while the puck has not yet entered that zone. The puck carrier can never be offside. Ghost clears the instant the skater retreats behind the blue line or the puck enters the zone. Blue line constant: `GameRules.BLUE_LINE_Z = 7.62`. Team 0 attacks toward -Z (offensive zone: z < -7.62); team 1 attacks toward +Z (offensive zone: z > 7.62).

**Icing:** `GameStateMachine` tracks the last carrier's team and Z position each tick. When the puck is free and crosses the opponent's goal line (|z| > `GameRules.GOAL_LINE_Z`), and the last carrier released from their own half (own side of center ice), icing triggers via `InfractionRules.check_icing`. The entire offending team is ghosted for `GameRules.ICING_GHOST_DURATION` (3s) or until the non-offending team picks up the puck. Icing state resets on faceoff prep.

**Network sync:** `is_ghost` is serialized in `SkaterNetworkState` (index 7). Host computes authoritatively: `GameStateMachine.compute_ghost_state(positions, carrier_peer_id, puck_position)` returns per-peer ghost flags, applied by `GameManager._apply_ghost_state()`. Clients predict offsides locally in `LocalController._predict_offside()` for instant feedback; icing ghost arrives via the 20Hz world state broadcast. `RemoteController._apply_state_to_skater()` applies ghost visual/collision from network state.

**Ghost implementation on `Skater`:** `set_ghost(bool)` toggles collision layers (blade area, body block area, skater body) and material transparency (alpha 0.3). Collision layer changes prevent all physics interaction — `move_and_slide` won't generate collisions with ghosts, blade areas won't trigger puck pickup, body block areas won't detect pucks. Safety guards in `Puck._on_blade_entered`, `on_body_block`, and `on_body_check` provide defense-in-depth against frame-ordering edge cases.

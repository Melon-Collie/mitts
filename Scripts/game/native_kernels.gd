# Visibility seam for the GDExtension hot-path kernels (native/). The wiring
# falls back to GDScript silently when the extension isn't built — right for
# CI and fresh clones, invisible in a playtest. This answers "which path am I
# actually on?": logged once at session start and carried in the debug digest
# (network_debug_overlay), so every pasted capture states its own engine.

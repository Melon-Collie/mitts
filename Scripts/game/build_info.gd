# Build version, baked in at export time; local editor runs stay as "dev". The
# deploy workflow (.github/workflows/deploy.yml) rewrites this to
# "0.1.<git rev-list --count HEAD>" before running the Godot export, and passes
# the same string as the GitHub Release name.

# Network protocol version, checked in the request_join handshake and stamped on
# Steam lobbies. Independent of VERSION: builds that don't touch the wire keep
# the same protocol and stay compatible. Per-version history: docs/protocol-history.md
#
# Bump this manually whenever ANY of these change:
#   - Wire format — world-state codec layout, input encoding, RPC signatures.
#     Mixed-protocol sessions decode positional binary as garbage that still
#     passes size checks, so the host must reject mismatched joiners outright.
#   - The RPC method SET — adding or removing an @rpc method shifts the
#     rpc-config ordering both peers hash, breaking cross-build RPC routing even
#     when every existing wire format is untouched.
#   - The legal RANGE of an existing field, even at the same wire type. An older
#     peer coerces the new value back into its own range and then simulates
#     different physics than the host, diverging prediction.

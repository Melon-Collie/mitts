class_name ClaimantView
extends RefCounted

# The claimant's own body and blade at the instant they reached — the half of a
# lag-compensated claim all four resolvers reconstruct identically, and the half
# a new resolver silently gets wrong.
#
# Three steps in order, and only the last one is obvious from the geometry:
#
#   1. Catch the body up to the self-view instant. That instant is NOT in the
#      host's buffer and cannot be — the host holds a client's input until its
#      stamp comes due, so the lookup lands past the newest sample and
#      StateBufferManager answers it with the newest entry and no signal at all.
#   2. Reach-clamp the client-sent point to that caught-up body.
#   3. Continuity-clamp it toward the host's own reconstruction, translated by
#      the same catch-up.
#
# Doing 2 and 3 without 1 is the failure with no symptom: both clamps then fence
# an honest full-extension claim against a body rewound short by
# (lead - one_way), and the claim just quietly misses. Routing every resolver
# through here is what makes the order structural instead of a bullet in
# Scripts/game/CLAUDE.md that the fifth resolver has to remember.
#
# One instance per resolver, reused — receive_claim is host-only and single-
# threaded, so the scratch below never overlaps a second claim.

class_name PickupClaimResolver
extends RefCounted

# Host-only resolver for client-initiated pickup claims with lag compensation:
# age check, blade/puck rewind, contest-window arbitration.
#
# The claimant's blade is CLIENT-AUTHORITATIVE (the client's precise "aim", sent
# in the claim). The host must not reconstruct it from its own lossy self-view
# snapshot — that reconstruction diverges from what the client saw, and the
# claimant watches the puck stick and then come loose. The host still owns the
# BODY: the puck is rewound as remote-view, the claimant's body position is read
# from the self-view snapshot, and the client blade is reach-clamped to that body
# (LagCompRewind.clamp_client_blade) so a modified client can't teleport its blade.
#
# Flow:
#   receive_claim(peer_id, host_ts, interp_delay, client_blade_curr/prev, top_hand)
#     → reject if puck locked, claim stale, skater missing/ghost, on cooldown
#     → rewind puck to LagCompRewind.puck_view_time and the claimant's body to
#       self_view_time(host_ts) — since the clock unification these are the SAME
#       instant (stamp + the claimant's input lead), so the puck and the blade
#       reaching for it are judged together; reach-clamp the client blade to that
#       body — never rtt/2
#     → reject if PuckInteractionRules.check_pickup fails against the client blade
#     → if a prior claim is pending and the two SELF-VIEW instants are within
#       CONTEST_WINDOW_S, contest; otherwise whoever reached first wins outright
#     → otherwise arm pending and wait CONTEST_WINDOW_S for a contender
#   tick(delta) [each host physics frame]
#     → after CONTEST_WINDOW_S with no contender, apply_lag_comp_pickup and clear
#   clear() [when puck is granted authoritatively]
#     → drop any pending claim
#
# Host-only by contract — caller gates on NetworkManager.is_host. Emits no
# signals: every effect is a method call on the injected puck controller.

# ── Claim-vs-present-time arbitration ────────────────────────────────────────
# The host's present-time pickup tick (PuckController._check_interactions) must
# route through here rather than granting unconditionally: an unconditional grant
# clears the pending claim, so a lag-comp claim sitting in its contest window
# always loses to a host-live blade (the host player's own, or a remote's
# replayed one) however much earlier it was stamped — "the host wins every 50/50"
# in a scramble. This entry point runs at the present-time grant moment and
# applies the same stamp-fairness rule the claim-vs-claim path uses, treating the
# live grab as a claim stamped `now`.
#
# Pure decision half, pinned by GUT. Both arguments are instants on the host
# timeline at which a blade reached the puck: `pending_view_time` is when the
# claimant reached (their self-view instant), `now` is when the live blade did.
# CONTESTED inside the contest window (a genuine 50/50 → squirt), PENDING_WON
# when the claimant reached first by more than the window — the grab happening
# before tick()'s window expiry is just RPC-arrival timing.
#
# Since claims are deferred to their own instant (DeferredClaimQueue) a pending
# claim is never armed before `now` reaches it, so `now - pending_view_time` is
# always >= 0 here. A live grab EARLIER than a still-parked claim needs no branch:
# it is granted unopposed, and the parked claim then self-rejects on release
# because the buffer at its own view time already shows the puck taken.

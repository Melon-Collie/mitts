class_name ClipFrameCapture
extends Node

# Off-screen frame grabber behind the goal-clip GIF export. Owns a small
# SubViewport whose camera mirrors whatever camera is currently live, and
# reads that viewport back into an Image at a fixed cadence.
#
# Why a second viewport rather than reading the main one: the main window is
# at the player's display resolution, so a per-frame readback moves ~8 MB and
# stalls on a GPU sync. The mirror renders at CAPTURE_SIZE, which is both the
# readback the export actually wants and small enough to grab without a
# visible hitch.
#
# The mirror renders only on capture ticks (UPDATE_ONCE, re-armed each tick),
# NOT every frame — it is a second full pass over the 3D scene, so at 60 fps
# UPDATE_ALWAYS would roughly double the scene's draw cost for frames that get
# thrown away. Rendering is therefore requested one tick and read the next:
# UPDATE_ONCE draws at the end of the frame that arms it, so the image only
# exists on the following frame (the same beat tools/pose_capture_runner.gd
# works on).
#
# Capture necessarily runs speculatively for the WHOLE clip — the player
# presses save partway through and expects the entire goal, so there is no
# version of this that starts on the press.
#
# Framing caveat: the mirror keeps the live camera's vertical FOV, so on a
# display that isn't 16:9 the GIF shows a different horizontal extent than the
# player saw. Vertical framing — where the cinematic's composition lives — is
# identical.

# left running, not an expected limit.

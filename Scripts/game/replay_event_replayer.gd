class_name ReplayEventReplayer
extends RefCounted

# Dispatches a recorded transient event (audio + body-check VFX) at replay
# time. Shared by GoalReplayDriver (in-memory recorder) and FileReplayDriver
# (.mreplay file events) so both replay paths fire the same sound/VFX with
# consistent payload handling.
#
# Events have shape:
#   { "kind": String, "pos": [x, y, z], "speed": float, ...kind-specific... }
# Position is stored as a 3-tuple Array so the file (JSON) and in-memory
# (Dictionary) producers can share one schema.
#
# Sound volume is recomputed from the recorded `speed` rather than reading
# puck.linear_velocity, which is zero during replay (apply_interpolated_snapshot
# writes velocity=ZERO to the frozen RigidBody).
#
# Pass `registry` for body_check events so the dispatcher can find the
# checker and victim skaters and drive SkaterVFX.fire_body_check_burst
# directly. We deliberately do NOT re-emit body_checked_player: that signal
# is wired to GameManager closures (sound, hit-landed stats, replay-event
# recording) that should not run during playback — the third would recurse.
# File-viewer callers pass a peer_id → PlayerRecord Dictionary via
# dispatch_with_records when no PlayerRegistry is available.


# Volume curve mirrors GameManager._puck_speed_volume so the host's live
# sound matches the replay's sound exactly. test_replay_audio_mirrors fails
# when the two drift.

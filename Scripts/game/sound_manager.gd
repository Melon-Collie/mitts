# ONE inverse-distance falloff for every world sound, at every camera, in every
# mode — the same curve `SkaterSoundController` gives the skate loops. Two dials,
# and neither is per-camera:
#
# Unit size is where the curve is anchored, and it is anchored on the LIVE camera
# because that is the shot the game is played in: the game cam frames the puck
# from ~15 m up, so events land around -8 dB — present and clearly placed, without
# bleeding across the rink.
#
# NO distance cutoff (Godot reads 0.0 as unlimited). The rink is 60 x 26 m and the
# camera pulls back off it, so listener-to-event distances past 40 m are ordinary
# rather than exceptional — a cutoff there silenced far-side play outright instead
# of merely quieting it. Unbounded, the curve keeps falling on its own (about
# -17 dB at 40 m, -21 dB at 65 m), which is the "audible but clearly over there"
# the cutoff was destroying.
#
# The cutoff is also why this used to be three presets a camera switched between:
# with a 40 m wall in the way, the replay cams — parked 4.5-38 m out — needed
# their own wider curves to reach past it at all. Take the wall away and the
# widening has nothing left to do, and a level that changes when the direction
# stays put is its own inconsistency. Replay is quieter than it was on the old
# REPLAY_FAR preset by design: it is the distance, not a mode.

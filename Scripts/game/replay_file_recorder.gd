extends RefCounted

# Streams a match to user://replays/<game_id>.mreplay: opening the file, the
# frame throttle, and the event stream. Lives on every peer (host + client +
# spectator) for any session with a non-empty game id and
# PlayerPrefs.replay_recording_enabled.
#
# A whole subsystem rather than a slice of the orchestrator: nothing here
# adjudicates anything, and nothing reads it back. It is one-way I/O, which is
# why it can be lifted out of GameManager without touching the claim routing
# next to it. GameManager keeps the file's CONTENT — the header and footer are
# built from the roster, the state machine and the shot log it owns — and hands
# them over; this owns the writer's lifecycle and the recording policy.
#
# Everything below is deliberately null-safe on a closed recorder: a session
# with recording off never opens one and every call is expected to no-op.

# The recording exists to be played back at a sane size, so ordinary frames are
# throttled to Constants.REPLAY_FILE_RATE. Two things bypass that: the first
# frame of a new phase (a keyframe — the faceoff snap, the resume after a
# movement-locked gap) and the goal moment, which comes through force_frame.

# Game IDs are UUIDs minted by PlayerPrefs.generate_uuid (hex + dashes). This
# guard runs on the path concatenation surface so a malicious host can't ship
# `../etc/passwd` via notify_game_reset and have a client write outside the
# replays folder. Belt-and-braces: the only legitimate source is already
# UUIDs, but the wire format permits arbitrary strings.

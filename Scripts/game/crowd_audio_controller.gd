extends Node

# Drives crowd audio: a looping ambient murmur that rides the danger on the ice,
# plus cheer one-shots on goals and period/game-end buzzers. Both stream types
# route through the dedicated "Arena" audio bus (created by SoundManager, shared
# with the horn/buzzer/whistle one-shots) so a single PlayerPrefs slider controls
# overall arena atmosphere independently of gameplay SFX.
#
# SoundManager stays one-shot-only — the looping ambient player and the small
# cheer pool both live here, mirroring how SkaterSoundController owns its own
# skate-loop AudioStreamPlayer3D.

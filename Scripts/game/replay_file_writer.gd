class_name ReplayFileWriter
extends RefCounted

# Streams broadcast frames (and small game-state events) to a .mreplay file
# via a dedicated background thread so per-frame disk writes never block the
# physics tick. Producer / consumer is mutex + semaphore: enqueue_frame /
# enqueue_event push completed records onto a queue and post the semaphore;
# the worker drains the queue on each wake.
#
# File format (.mreplay v1, magic "MREPLAY3"):
#   [ MAGIC "MREPLAY3"  : 8 bytes      ]
#   [ FORMAT_VERSION    : u8           ]    -- reader rejects any other value
#   [ HEADER LENGTH     : u32 LE       ]
#   [ HEADER JSON       : N bytes      ]    -- game_id, build_version, roster, …
#   ([ FRAME LENGTH     : u32 LE       ]
#    [ host_ts          : u32 LE       ]    -- 0.1ms units (TIME_WIRE_SCALE)
#    [ kind             : u8           ]    -- KIND_WORLD_STATE | KIND_EVENT
#    [ payload          : (len-5) bytes])*
#   [ END_OF_RECORDS    : u32 LE = 0   ]    -- sentinel marking clean shutdown
#   [ FOOTER LENGTH     : u32 LE       ]
#   [ FOOTER JSON       : N bytes      ]
#
# Versioning: the magic distinguishes incompatible-format generations (a v1
# reader must reject a v2 file outright). The u8 version byte distinguishes
# additive evolutions within a magic family — a future v2 reader can fast-path
# skip-forward when the version is older. Bump the magic for breaking changes;
# bump the version byte for additive changes.
#
# Crash-safety: a process kill mid-write leaves the file without
# END_OF_RECORDS; the reader walks records until it can't read a full frame
# and reports `truncated = true`. Only the in-flight frame is lost.

# PackedByteArray() can't be a const expression in GDScript, so this is a
# `static var` initialized once at class load. Same access pattern
# (ReplayFileWriter.MAGIC) for callers.

# framing here: the frames are raw broadcast packets, and the reader matches this
# version by strict equality rather than decoding an older layout.

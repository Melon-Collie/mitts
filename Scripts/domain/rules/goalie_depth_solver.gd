class_name GoalieDepthSolver

# Composition of the goalie's depth constraints — the one place that answers
# "given everything pulling on my depth at once, where do I stand, and how fast do
# I get there?"
#
# The composition rule, which is the whole design and states itself:
#   * every constraint is a MAXIMUM RADIUS the goalie may hold;
#   * the target is the tightest of them (floored, so no cap can bury him in the net);
#   * the approach RATE is the rush backflow's when it binds, otherwise the
#     ordinary settle.
# So statement ORDER is not load-bearing, and a further constraint is one more
# field rather than another line in a hand-ordered sequence.
#
# There is deliberately no distance CURVE. The Buckley A/B/C/D zones are defined
# SITUATIONALLY, not by distance (A entering the zone, B a settled shot, C a live
# lateral play, D on the post), and the situational models here already describe
# them: rush backflow = A, backdoor cap = C, RVH/VH = D. Depth is the solve those
# models imply — go as far out as the races allow — so the zones are emergent.
# Nothing binding means a genuine 1v0 is challenged aggressively (correct: there
# is no lateral option to punish it), a live receiver pulls him back via the
# re-square race, and the standoff keeps him off the puck in tight.
#
# He is NOT simply parked deeper. At this game's shot speeds the flight time
# inside ~7 m is SHORTER than the arm read (0.108 s at 5 m vs 0.18 s cold), so
# depth cannot buy usable reaction time in the slot: cutting the angle is what
# makes the save there, not reflexes.
#
# Pure/static, engine-free, unit-testable. Callers own the Constraints instance
# (rebuilt in place each tick) so the hot path allocates nothing.

	# PHYSICAL STANDOFF — he must stay goal-side of the puck; without it the solve
	# happily puts him level with (or past) an in-tight threat. Not a tuning
	# curve: body half-depth plus stick clearance.
	var standoff_cap: float = INF
	# Lateral TRACKING cap — the deepest radius from which he can still stay square
	# to a carrier moving the puck across (the anticipatory deke / walkout answer).
	# INF when nothing binds.
	var lateral_cap: float = INF
	# Backdoor re-square race cap (GoalieBehaviorRules.backdoor_depth_cap).
	# INF when no weak-side one-timer threat binds.

	# on top of him hides the release and stepping in would let him see it.

# Resolve this tick's depth from `current`.
#
# NOTE the rush radius is deliberately NOT floored, unlike the two caps. It cannot
# need the floor: `rush_retreat_depth` interpolates between the chart's own
# anchors, the deepest of which IS the floor, so it can never ask for less. Kept
# explicit so a future edit to the backflow anchors does not silently gain the
# ability to bury the goalie.

# THE settled depth for a set of constraints — the tightest cap, floored, with the

# toward it via `solve`, and the bot planner reads it directly
# (AIActionScoring.planned_goalie_depth) so the two cannot drift.
#
# Keeping this a separate entry point matters. The planner has no per-tick state
# to integrate and wants the STEADY-STATE answer; the controller needs the

# reaches both by construction instead of by a comment asking someone to remember.

class_name NetBladeCollision

# The stick's collision with the net. Two materials, because a real goal is two
# materials and they behave nothing alike:
#
#   PIPES (posts) — hard, thin, exactly where they are drawn. The blade stops on
#     iron, and a carried puck driven into iron is stripped off the pipe's own
#     reflection (SkaterIKCoordinator). Ringing a post should cost you the puck.
#   TWINE (sides, back) — compliant. The blade sinks in to `mesh_give` against
#     the mesh and stops there. It is NOT teleported to a face, and touching
#     twine does NOT strip the puck: a stick buried in the side mesh simply
#     cannot do anything, which is what physically happens and what reads
#     correctly.
#
# There is no legality concept here — no "did you enter through the mouth", no
# mouth column, no `allow_front`. This is a surface. A puck ends up in the net
# only by going through the mouth, because the mouth is the only opening; see
# `docs/net-play-plan.md` §3.
#
# The blade is a SEGMENT (heel → toe), not a point. It has to be: a post is 3 cm
# across and a blade ~30 cm long, so a stick sweeping across the post with both
# ends clear is the case that decides wraparound goals, and it is invisible to
# any point sample. (The boards test the same two ends —
# `Skater.clamp_blade_to_walls`.)
#
# Pure and allocation-free: fills a caller-owned Result.

class Result:
	# World-space translation to apply to the blade. The caller owns the blade
	# anchor (a heel, in practice) and moves it by this; the arm is then rebuilt
	# to reach it via TopHandIK.hand_for_clamped_blade.
	var offset: Vector3 = Vector3.ZERO
	# Outward normal of the pipe struck, or ZERO when only twine was touched.
	# Non-zero is the strip signal AND the direction the puck leaves along.

	func hit() -> bool:
		return offset != Vector3.ZERO or pipe_normal != Vector3.ZERO


# Resolve the blade segment against the near end's net. `prev` is used only to
# classify which side of the two-sided twine the stick is on, and must be a
# side_anchor rather than a raw contact (SkaterIKCoordinator keeps it): a contact
# pressed into the twine sits on either side of the plane, and classifying from
# that flips the face holding the stick.
#
# `half_thickness` is the blade's own reach perpendicular to the segment;
# `mesh_give` is how deep the twine lets it sink before stopping.
#
# Returns true when anything was hit.

# Passive-blade deflection via a NORMAL/TANGENTIAL decomposition of the incoming
# velocity against the blade face. contact_normal is the blade face normal
# (unit, points against the incoming puck). Returns new horizontal velocity (no
# Y). Drives BOTH the natural too-fast-to-catch deflect and the deliberate
# redirect (hold LMB without the puck) — one model, so they always feel identical.
#
# The incoming velocity is split into the component INTO the face (normal) and the
# component ALONG the face (tangential). The normal part rebounds with restitution
# `e`; the tangential part is kept by `tangential_retain`. Two real outcomes fall
# out of this ONE model, no hand-drawn curve:
#   - a SQUARE hit (nearly all normal) off a hard puck → low e → the puck dies in
#     front (the "bobble": knocked down, not held);
#   - a GLANCING hit (mostly tangential) → the glance survives → the puck keeps its
#     pace and only its LINE changes (a true tip / redirect).
# This is why it needs no angle cap: the only way to reverse the puck is a square
# hit, and a square hard hit is killed by the low restitution — there is no fast
# carom to clamp.
#
# `e` eases from normal_restitution (soft/slow puck) toward normal_restitution_min
# (hard puck) as speed climbs to speed_ref — a hard puck deadens more head-on, so
# a squared blade smothers a slapper into a bobble instead of caroming it.
# normal_restitution_min < 0 disables the falloff (flat e). tangential_retain is
# flat: a glance keeps its pace regardless of speed (that IS the redirect).
#
# Deliberately WORLD-frame / blade-static — do NOT fold blade velocity into the
# bounce (blade-frame decomposition, sweep-adds-pace). The blade IK-chases the
# cursor every frame, so its instantaneous velocity at contact is aim noise, not
# intent: identical-looking tips would come off at different paces depending on
# where the cursor was mid-flick. Same reason reception has no cushion term.
# (Reception's relative frame uses the SKATER's velocity, which is smooth and
# deliberate — that's the distinction.)

# The same decomposition in 3D, for a surface whose normal can point anywhere —
# a goalie's pad, blocker, chest or paddle (GoalieSaveRules.rebound_velocity).
# `deflect_velocity` is horizontal-only because a blade's lift is a separate,
# deliberate channel (deflect_loft_speed); a body has no such channel and its
# faces are tilted, so the vertical has to come out of the contact itself.
#
# Identical model otherwise, and identical for the same reason: ONE contact
# model means a glance off a pad and a glance off a blade cannot disagree about
# what a glance is. `e` eases from `soft` toward `hard` as the impact speed
# climbs to `speed_ref` — the puck's own COR falling with impact speed — so a
# hard shot retains a smaller FRACTION while still rebounding faster in absolute
# terms, which is why hard shots make dangerous rebounds and soft ones die.
#
# `normal` points out of the surface, toward the puck. A separating puck is
# returned unchanged, so re-testing a puck already ejected off a face never
# re-reflects it. With `retain` 1.0 and no speed falloff this reduces exactly to
# PuckGeometryCollision.reflect_3d.

# Signed vertical launch speed for a deflect's redirect (fed to

# drives the puck down, zero keeps it flat.
#
# The LEVEL names the deflection intent outright — the four loft levels double
# as DEFLECT MODES (docs/elevation-rework-plan.md v3 §3), and the blade's lift
# height follows the level so each mode plays its own plane:
#   FLAT — blade on the ice: a ground puck stays on the ground (redirect
#          along the ice; "down" is meaningless there).
#   LOW  — blade on the ice: a ground puck deflects UP — the money tip.
#   MID  — blade lifted to the low air (~0.35 m pivot): an airborne puck
#          deflects UP — roof the rising shot.
#   HIGH — blade lifted high (~0.52 m pivot, reaching ~1.05 m): an airborne
#          puck bats DOWN — the high-feed knockdown at the net mouth.
# The sign is the player's stated intent, never puck-vs-blade geometry at the
# contact, so two identical contacts cannot flip outcome on a centimetre of
# height. Anti-cheese is preserved by the PIVOT
# heights, not a gate: a saucer pass apexes ~0.21–0.26 m — under the MID
# pivot — so camping an air mode still only ever meets genuinely high pucks.

# would have applied, and the exact model Trajectory.predict uses for
# predicted board bounces, so a rescued rim is indistinguishable from a

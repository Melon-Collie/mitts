# Pure save resolution: what the puck does after it meets the goalie.
#
# It is a CONTACT, not a choice. The puck strikes a surface with a material and
# an orientation, and the rebound follows from the two — the same
# normal/tangential decomposition the blade deflect and the boards use
# (PuckCollisionRules.deflect_velocity_3d), through the real outward normal the
# swept-OBB test reports. There is no menu of save outcomes to pick from, no
# speed at which the model changes character, and no exit vector written down in
# advance.
#
# TWO THINGS ARE NOT CONTACTS, and both are the same kind of exception: they are
# things the goalie DOES rather than things his equipment is made of.
#
#   GLOVE CATCH  — a puck does not stop because leather is soft, it stops
#                  because he closes his hand on it. The only outcome that ENDS
#                  a play, so the whistle depends on it.
#   CHEST TRAP   — a shot into the chest of a squared goalie is a dead play: he
#                  smothers it against his body and it drops in front of him. It
#                  does NOT end the play here (the ruleset is deliberately
#                  low-stoppage — he does not cover for a whistle); it is the
#                  first beat of a two-beat sequence whose second beat is the
#                  crease sweep. See CHEST_TRAP_DROP_M_S, which is coupled to
#                  that sweep's window and has a test holding the pair together.
#
# Both are gated on `is_face_presented` and nothing else: what he can smother or
# catch is what he is looking at. A puck into his back is equipment, and
# equipment is a material.
#
# Deterministic (no randomness) so a client-predicted puck and the host agree
# before reconciliation.

# Which save surface the puck struck. Ordering is load-bearing: it indexes
# MATERIALS. MASK is separate from CHEST because they resolve oppositely — he
# smothers with his chest and he emphatically does not smother with his face.
enum SavePart { STICK, PAD, BLOCKER, CHEST, GLOVE, MASK }

# ── Materials ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Three numbers per surface, flat, indexed by SavePart × STRIDE: the restitution
# against a SLOW puck, the restitution at/above SPEED_REF_M_S, and how much of a
# glance along the face survives.
#
# The speed falloff is the puck's own measured behaviour, not a shaping curve:
# COR drops roughly linearly with impact speed (0.50 at 15 mph to 0.34 at 85
# against a rigid plate; a frozen game-temperature puck plateaus near 0.27 — WSU
# Sports Science Lab, "Experimental Characterization of Ice Hockey Sticks and
# Pucks"). Every surface here is softer than that rigid plate, so every row sits
# under it.
#
# THE ORDERING IS THE PHYSICAL CLAIM, not the digits. Stiffest to softest: a
# composite paddle is the hardest thing on him; a blocker is a board behind thin
# foam; a leg pad is thick foam over a stiff core, built to absorb; a chest
# protector is foam over a torso that gives; and softest of all is a glove the
# hand did not close on, which is a floppy leather pocket. Move a row and you are
# asserting something about the equipment — keep the order.
#
# What used to be here instead: a speed threshold that switched between a
# scripted cornerward exit and a reflection. Nothing physical happens to a pad at
# 28 m/s, and the scripted branch kept 82% of pad rebounds in the slot because a
# constant vector cannot know where the shot came from
# (test_goalie_rebound_destination).

# How fast a trapped puck slides off the chest and onto the ice. NOT a rebound —
# his momentum is gone and this is the puck coming off a padded, forward-tilted
# face under gravity, which is why it is a walking pace and takes its DIRECTION
# from the contact normal rather than from any goalie-frame constant.
#
# IT IS COUPLED TO HIS STICK, and that coupling is the whole reason the number
# matters. He only reaches for a puck slower than GoalieCreaseClear
# .max_puck_speed, and only gains it while it is still inside his blade's reach —
# faster, and it drifts out of reach before the stick gets there, leaving it
# loose in the paint, which is the opposite of a dead play.
# test_a_trapped_chest_puck_is_slow_enough_to_play holds the speed half;
# test_chest_trap_clears_his_own_stick measures the whole sequence live.

# body in and out, so the impact speed the material responds to is the RELATIVE
# one. Resolving in the surface's frame — subtract, reflect, add back — is what
# makes that true, and it degrades exactly to the static case when the part is
# still, so a fixture that offers no velocity gets today's numbers unchanged.
#
# Only the NORMAL component of the surface's motion enters. That is the same
# frictionless-tangent claim deflect_velocity_3d already makes for the puck's own
# glance: the face drives the puck along its normal and does not carry it
# sideways. Adding the tangential part would assert a grip on the puck that
# nothing here has measured.
#
# The consequence worth knowing at a call site: a puck at REST against an
# advancing face leaves at (1 + e) times the face's normal speed rather than
# sitting still while the collider walks through it, and a retreating face
# leaves it at rest rather than dragging it along.

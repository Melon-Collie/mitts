# The goalie's BODY, as one source of truth.
#
# ── Why this exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Nothing connects a literal to the collider it was copied from, so a planner
# holding its own numbers for how wide the pads splay or how far the glove
# reaches drifts silently off the body that actually makes the saves. Every
# read of the keeper's shape is derived from here instead, so changing the body
# moves the planner for free.
#
# This file is the goalie's dimensions. GoalieStickRules is his stick (same
# pattern, split out because the blade also owns an aim solve). Between them,
# anything the planner believes about the keeper's SHAPE should come from here.
#
# ── Scope: shape, not skill ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Physical CAPABILITY (reaction delays, push speed, butterfly drop time) is not
# here — it is tier-varied and already shared through GoalieSkillProfile /
# set_goalie_profile, which is the correct mechanism. And the BOT's own decision
# knobs (action hysteresis, settle references) are not claims about the goalie
# at all, so they are not anatomy either. This file answers exactly one
# question: how big is he, and where.
#
# Values mirror Scenes/Goalie.tscn's collision shapes and GoalieController's
# pose exports; the controller and pose builder default FROM these so there is
# one place to change.

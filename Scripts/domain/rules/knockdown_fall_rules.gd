class_name KnockdownFallRules

# Pure math for the knockdown fall pose: a checked player tips about the skates
# in the hit direction, bounces off the ice, and lies flat until the get-up.
#
# Grounded model, not an authored curve: the body is a rigid rod pivoting at the
# ice under a constant angular acceleration (gravity torque), seeded with the
# tip rate the hit's shove actually imparted (shove speed / COM height — the
# angular momentum the impulse put about the skate pivot). Ice contact reflects
# the tip rate through a restitution, so the bounce count and rhythm fall out of
# the impact speed instead of being keyframed. The lying pose is solved, not
# authored: the waist fold resolves to the ground-plane complement (fold_at)
# and the limbs scatter from first impact by the hit's own momentum and side
# (sprawl_into), so no two falls settle identically. Everything is a
# closed-form function of elapsed down-time, so every machine — and reconcile
# replay — renders the identical fall from the replicated knockdown timer.

# the torso IN the ground plane (π/2 − tilt), because holding the airborne curl
# through the landing folds the chest through the ice on a full fall and
# dropping the fold entirely props the body up as a plank. Blending on
# tilt/settle rather than time means every restitution bounce re-flexes the

# (GaitPose.FOOT_FWD), and folding the shin back swings that offset down by
# legs.z·sin α, so the rise is (thigh + shin)·(1 − cos α) − legs.z·sin α. This
# is the buckle pose that keeps the boots at the ice while the gait's crumple
# sinks the body by the drop. Returned as (hip pitch, knee fold) in the

#   1. Buckle — both legs collapse into the crouch that matches the gait's
#      crumple drop (buckle_angles), from the instant the drop lands.
#   2. Sprawl — from first ice contact the loose limbs scatter: the leg the
#      body fell onto stays pinned and folds deeper; the top leg extends and
#      splays wide. Scatter scale rides the entry tip rate (a harder hit flings
#      the limbs wider) and the side follows the fall's lateral lean, so the
#      lying pose varies hit-to-hit instead of being one authored keyframe.
# `fall_dir` is the body-local fall direction (the recoil dir, unit XZ);
# falling toward +X lands on the right side, which frees the LEFT leg on top.
# `scatter_scale` fades the scatter alone (the get-up); the buckle follows
# `drop`, which the caller eases itself.

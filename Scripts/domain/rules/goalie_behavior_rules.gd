# ── Arc-based positioning ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Real goalies skate the "challenge angle" arc — a constant-radius path
# around the goal center. This naturally pulls them back on sharp angles: they
# sit shallower in perpendicular depth as the puck moves wide.
#
# `radius` is the distance from goal center; callers compute it with the
# existing depth chart against `threat_distance_to_goal`.
#
# ── PAST THE POST THE ARC IS NOT AVAILABLE, AND CLAMPING IS NOT THE ANSWER ───
# Beyond a certain angle the challenge line leaves the mouth entirely: standing
# square at the chart's radius would put the goalie OUTSIDE his own post.
# Clamping `x` back inside while keeping the arc's `z` is the worst of both —
# the resulting point is not on the squaring line at all, and it strands him on
# the near post at challenge depth.
#
# That is not a small positional error, because the goalie is a WALL, not a disc.
# His pads splay perpendicular to his facing, so squaring to a sharp-angle
# shooter rotates that wall until it runs nearly PARALLEL to the shot lane —
# pointing out of the net instead of across it. Measured at 5 m / 70 deg the
# clamped position conceded the far four fifths of the mouth along the ice with
# the puck never touching him (benchmarks/test_goalie_vs_xg_baseline.gd).
#
# So past the exit angle he gives up challenge depth continuously and converges
# on the post-seal spot — the SAME position post-integration puts him in, so the
# handoff at `post_integration_angle_deg` is continuous by construction and there
# is no cliff at the trigger. The blend endpoints are both physical (where the

# off the ice, essentially motionless, and inside the goalie's horizontal body
# footprint must be sitting ON him (classically: a deadened save settling on
# top of the butterfly pads). That puck is unplayable through every normal
# path — grounded blades can't reach an "airborne" puck and the crease sweep
# refuses pucks above the ice — and in real hockey it's a covered puck anyway,
# so the caller answers it with the smother. All inputs are physical
# measurements: `min_height` is the sweepable-ice ceiling (below it the sweep
# owns the puck), `max_height` the pad/lap shelf envelope the glove can
# actually pin, `body_radius` the butterfly's horizontal span. Near-rest is
# enforced by the caller's dwell (a puck must HOLD this window, not cross it),
# so `max_speed` only excludes clearly-live pucks.

# ── Screen occlusion (grounded sightline model) ──────────────────────────────
# A body between the shooter and the goalie hides the puck: the goalie can't start
# their read until they SEE the puck leave the shadow of the screener. This returns
# that pickup delay in SECONDS, built from geometry + shot speed rather than a flat
# "screened → +X ms" fudge.
#
# ── The shadow, solved from the goalie's eye ─────────────────────────────────
# A screen is a fact about ONE line: goalie → puck. A body standing on that line
# casts a shadow the width of its own silhouette, and the puck is hidden for
# exactly as long as it stays inside it. Two consequences fall out, and they are
# the whole model:
#
#   THE RELEASE HAS TO BE HIDDEN. If the goalie saw the puck leave the blade, he
#   has the trajectory; a body it flies past afterwards can obscure it but cannot
#   un-read it. Only a shooter who is himself behind the screen costs the goalie
#   the pickup. Never test against the SHOT line instead: that charges the goalie
#   for every body near the flight path including ones nowhere near his eyeline,
#   and simultaneously lets a body standing DEAD IN FRONT OF HIM off for a shot
#   aimed at a post, because the flight path diverges from the sightline by more
#   than a body width over 10 m.
#
#   IT ENDS WHEN THE PUCK LEAVES THE SHADOW, not when it draws level with the
#   body. A shot angled away from the screener clears his silhouette early; only
#   one fired straight down the sightline stays hidden the whole way in. That is
#   the difference between the deadly dead-on net-front screen and traffic the
#   goalie can see around, and it is geometry rather than a tuned curve.
#
# A BODY IS NOT A COLUMN, AND THAT IS WHERE THE SIGHT COMES FROM. The silhouette
# that matters is the one at the height the sightline actually passes through him,
# and the sightline to a puck on the ice runs DOWNWARD from the goalie's eye: it
# crosses a near screener at chest height (wide — the full torso) and a distant
# one down at the skates (narrow, with daylight between the legs). That is exactly
# the difference between the doorstep screen you cannot see through and the slot
# traffic you find the puck under, and it is why a goalie drops to find a puck in
# a crowd — going down lowers his eye, which drops the whole sightline into the
# leg band. One silhouette function, three measurements, no screening curve.
#
# Evaluated in the XZ plane (bodies + shots live on the ice), in the goalie's
# frame: `p` is the release point relative to his eye, the puck rides
# `d(s) = p + s·v̂`, and the screener sits at `w`. Occlusion is
# |w × d(s)| < radius·|d(s)| — a quadratic in `s`, so the exit distance is a root
# solve, no stepping. The half-width is taken once per screener, from the sightline
# height at the RELEASE: that is the moment that decides whether the goalie ever
# had the puck, and holding it fixed keeps the exit a closed-form root rather than
# a march. The worst (longest-hiding) screener wins; the shooter self-excludes via
# `min_along`. The caller clamps the result to a cap (and to the flight time).
# Returns 0 for a clean look. No allocation (scalar loop over the caller-owned
# positions array).
# NO OVER-THE-HEAD CLEARANCE, deliberately. The obvious companion rule — a
# sightline passing above the screener's helmet is clean — would be read off two
# rigs that were never authored against each other (the goalie's head sits at
# 1.79 in GoalieAnatomy; the skater's helmet mesh is a shade over 1.5), and with
# those numbers a STANDING goalie looks straight over every body in the slot and
# the doorstep screen stops existing. That is a coincidence of two independent

# ── Fighting for sight (the peek) ────────────────────────────────────────────
# A screened goalie does not stand still and accept being blind. The first thing
# taught is to get the eyes around the body — step off the line just far enough
# that the shooter reappears past the screener's shoulder — and it is a genuine
# TRADE, not a free save: every centimetre of peek is a centimetre off the angle,
# so the side he steps away from opens. The model prices the step; the caller's
# cap decides how much net he is willing to sell for the look.
#
# Geometry, and it is the same lever the occlusion solve uses, read backwards. The
# sightline pivots about the RELEASE POINT, so a step `Δ` at the goalie's end
# moves the line by `Δ·(1−f)` where `f` is the screener's fraction of the way to
# the puck: a body at his doorstep is shoved out of the way by almost the whole
# step, a body standing on the shooter cannot be stepped around at all (f→1). Only
# the component of a lateral step perpendicular to the sightline does any work,
# hence the `|vhz|` — against a shot from straight out to the side, stepping in x
# barely turns the line and the peek correctly reports "no".
#
# TWO REFUSALS, and they are the reason this cannot become a free buff:
#   * A screen he cannot clear inside `max_offset` returns ZERO. Half a peek buys
#     no sight and still costs the angle. If you cannot get your eyes around it,
#     stay square and block it — which is exactly what the block-or-react model
#     then does with the undiminished screen delay.
#   * Bodies on BOTH sides return zero too. Bracketed, there is no side to step
#     to; stepping either way trades one screen for another.
#
# CALL THIS WITH THE SQUARE (angle-solve) POSITION, not his live one. The peek is
# an offset FROM his angle, so feeding back his already-peeked position would let
# him step, see, un-step, be blinded, and oscillate at the tick rate. Asking "from
# where I want to stand, what is hidden?" makes the input independent of the
# output. Returns a signed world-X offset. No allocation.
#
# A body standing ON the sightline has no side of its own, so `prefer_side` (the
# sign of the peek he is already holding) picks it: a goalie commits to a side of
# a dead-on screen and stays there. Without it the side came from float noise in

# ── Beaten-wide detection (drop-and-seal trigger) ────────────────────────────
# A carrier driving laterally across the crease face beats a standing goalie to
# the short side when the goalie physically can't stay square: the tuck point
# is the post on the side the carrier is moving toward, and this is a straight
# race to it. The goalie's required travel is the true 2D distance from their
# challenge position back to the post seal spot, less pad reach — being out on
# the arc is exactly what makes the reach-around work, so the retreat distance
# must count. When the race is lost, standing tracking is unwinnable and the
# correct read is drop + butterfly-slide post seal (the caller's job).
#
# THE TUCK IS PLAYED BY THE PUCK, NOT THE BODY — the point of no return. A
# body driving toward a post with the puck still on the far side (the classic
# forehand-drag drive: skate across, puck trailing, wrap to the backhand once
# the goalie sells out) has committed NOTHING — the wrap/cut-back is free, and
# a pads-first commit at that moment is exactly what the move is fishing for.
# The commit gate is therefore positional on the PUCK: it must already be past
# the goalie's standing sealing reach on the drive side. Beyond that line the
# attacker has genuinely spent the play — bringing the puck back means the
# full trip around the body from deep — so committing there is safe by
# geometry, not by guessing intent.
#
# The CLOCK is the puck's too, and for the same reason. The puck's arrival at
# the tuck point is what scores, so its own lateral rate is what the goalie is
# racing — never the carrier's body. The move this rule exists for is exactly
# where the two differ: a forehand→backhand beat on a rush is a shooter driving
# STRAIGHT AT the net (almost no lateral body velocity) who moves the PUCK
# across the crease faster than the goalie can push. Racing the puck's
# distance-to-post against the body's speed also mixes two objects' kinematics
# into one race.
#
# ONSET AND PERSISTENCE ARE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS, which is why there are two
# functions. `is_beaten_wide` is the onset: it needs the puck genuinely moving
# across, because a puck that is not going anywhere has not beaten anybody yet.
# `beaten_wide_holds` keeps the verdict alive afterwards and drops the velocity
# term entirely — the beat is a fact about GEOMETRY, and a puck that decelerates
# once it is around the goalie does not un-beat him. Asking the onset question
# every tick instead is self-cancelling: the verdict would turn off at the exact
# moment the move completes and the puck settles wide, which is when the seal is
# most needed. Only bringing the puck back inside the sealing reach (or out of
# the in-tight zone) releases it.
#
# Deliberately NOT triggered by: the puck trailing the drive (above), slow
# lateral movement (min_lateral_speed — genuine puck travel, not a jitter; stay
# up and force the release), threats outside max_threat_distance (a fast cut
# at the top of the slot has too many options to commit against), or threats

# ── Rush retreat (speed-matched backflow) ────────────────────────────────────

# ── Lateral tracking cap (the deke / walkout answer) ────────────────────────
# The deepest challenge radius from which the goalie can still STAY SQUARE to a
# carrier moving the puck laterally — the anticipatory answer to "how far out dare
# I come against someone who can take it around me?"
#
# This is a RATE constraint, not a race, and that distinction is the whole model.
# A pass is a discrete event: it happens, then the goalie reacts, so the backdoor
# cap prices it as react-delay + travel (see backdoor_depth_cap). A deke or walkout
# is CONTINUOUS — the goalie tracks it the whole way — so there is no reaction
# delay to pay, only the question of whether he can turn as fast as the puck.
#
# Geometry: staying square to a threat `d` away moving laterally at `v` means
# holding an angular rate of v/d. At challenge radius r that costs a linear
# push of r·v/d, so the constraint is
#     r · v / d  <=  push_speed        =>     r <= push_speed · d / v
# which says exactly what it should: the closer the carrier and the faster he moves
# it across, the less depth you can afford. Coming out is a bet that he shoots
# rather than moves — and this is the price of that bet.

# ── Backdoor-aware depth cap ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A goalie who sees a one-timer threat on the weak side doesn't challenge the
# carrier as far out: depth trades shot-angle coverage against the time to
# re-square across to the new shot line when the pass goes. Grounded race:
#   time the play needs   = pass flight (puck→shooter / pass_speed)
#                           + the receiver's release swing
#   time the goalie loses = read delay before the push engages
#   coverable distance    = reachable_lateral_distance over what's left
# At challenge radius r along the goal→threat ray, the goalie sits r·sin(θ)
# off the goal→shooter shot line (θ between the two rays), so the cap solves
# r·sin(θ) <= coverable — the largest radius from which he still arrives.
# θ→0 (shooter on the carrier's line) needs no re-square → INF, no cap;
# an unwinnable race returns 0 (caller floors at its defensive depth). The
# result only ever *repositions* — the actual cross-crease save still runs the
# honest react/push race, so respecting the backdoor opens the carrier's
# direct-shot angle instead of buffing the goalie into a wall.
#
# ── HE HAS DEFENCEMEN ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Backing off for a covered man gives away the carrier's angle for nothing, and
# means a defenceman doing his job buys his goalie nothing at all.
#
# Coverage enters in the model's own currency, TIME, and as a race like
# everything else: `defender_arrival_time` is how long until the nearest
# defender's stick can reach the reception point. A defender who is ALREADY
# there disputes the feed for the puck's whole flight, so the play needs the
# flight twice over; one who arrives exactly as the puck does adds nothing; one
# who is late is worth nothing and never shortens the play. No threshold, no
# "is covered" boolean — the credit is `t_pass − t_defender`, floored at zero
# and naturally capped at the flight itself.
#
# This is a positioning trade, not a save buff, and it cuts both ways: the
# goalie challenges harder when the back door is covered and gives up more if
# the feed still gets through, and he retreats the moment his D leaves. Bad

#

#   property and barely moves with body state; the measured expert/novice split in
#   keeper decision time (~250-260 ms vs ~320 ms) is an expertise gap, not a
#   posture gap. A goalie mid-push saw the release fine. What he cannot do is
#   cancel his momentum, and THAT cost is paid as drift carried through the
#   reaction freeze (GoalieController._reaction_drift_x), not as latency here.
#   This is only the residual for an off-balance body firing a response it has
#   already chosen.
#
#   SCRAMBLING (`scramble_delay`, larger) — standing up out of a butterfly or
#   sitting on a committed lunge is not a perception problem either, but the
#   response genuinely is not AVAILABLE yet: the limbs are travelling back under
#   him, so there is nothing to fire until they arrive. There is no lateral
#   momentum in that failure for the drift to model, which is why it keeps a real
#   latency cost where the travelling case does not.
#
# Loading the whole caught-moving cost onto one latency instead makes the penalty
# binary in RANGE rather than proportional: absorbed entirely by a point shot's
# ~0.57 s flight, and larger than a 5 m slot shot's ~0.20 s flight, so against a

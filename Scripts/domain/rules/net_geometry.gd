# Where the net IS — one definition, read by everything that collides with it.
#
# There must be exactly ONE net: a loose puck, a carried puck and the blade all
# solve against these surfaces. Two descriptions of the cage (a real one for the
# puck, a padded box for the blade) means a player crossing between a loose puck
# and a carried one crosses between two different nets, which is what makes the
# area feel broken rather than merely hard. See `docs/net-play-plan.md` §1.
#
# Nothing here knows about restitution, pucks, or sticks. Consumers bring their
# own clearance (a puck's radius, a blade's half-thickness) and their own
# response. The surfaces are shared; the reactions are not.

# The back twine leans: full NET_DEPTH at the ice, tapering to NET_TOP_DEPTH
# under the crossbar, because a real NHL goal is shallow at the top shelf.
# Negative — the twine gets shallower as it rises.

# answers "which side of it am I on" for the whole rink, and both ends of the ice
# are behind it. Skipping this let the back face claim contacts that were never
# its own: it pinned a stick out by the corner boards to a surface metres away,
# and it answered for a puck rounding the cage's back corner, whose contact
# belonged to the SIDE mesh — so the side mesh never got asked and the puck kept
# creeping in.
#

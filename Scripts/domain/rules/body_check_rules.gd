class_name BodyCheckRules

# Pure math for the "stagger" debuff a body check inflicts on its victim: a
# temporary thrust and edge-grip penalty, scaled by how hard the hit landed. Kept
# pure (static, no engine state) so it unit-tests without a live skater and —
# like SkaterMovementRules — survives client-side prediction + reconcile: the
# victim's stagger_timer is replicated, snapped to the host baseline at replay
# start, and decays deterministically.
#
# "How hard" is the victim's transfer-impulse magnitude — the m/s velocity delta
# the hit imparts (= approach x weight_ratio x effective_transfer, so both
# bodies' mass and the closing speed feed it) — normalized to 0..1 between
# min_impulse (below which a bump inflicts nothing) and ref_impulse (a
# full-strength check).
#
# One float, stagger_timer (seconds remaining), encodes BOTH the penalty depth
# and the recovery window: a harder hit sets a longer timer, and the per-tick
# penalties are proportional to the timer that remains, so depth and duration
# scale together off a single replicated value and ease back as it decays.

class Config:
	# Defaults mirror SkaterController's @export tunables (the authoritative
	# source). The stagger band is tuned to the inelastic magnitudes: ref_impulse
	# equals the puck-strip threshold (1.35), so a full-strength check is exactly
	# a puck-dislodging check — landing at ~4 m/s closing for a medium build (0.65
	# transfer), ~3.4 for a heavy one ("skate into them with some pace", not a
	# full-speed-only collision). See the ladder derivation on
	# SkaterController.stagger_min_impulse.
	var min_impulse: float = 0.6          # m/s victim velocity delta below which no debuff lands
	var ref_impulse: float = 1.35         # m/s delta treated as a full-strength check (== puck-strip threshold)
	var max_stagger_seconds: float = 1.0  # recovery window of a full-strength check
	var max_thrust_penalty: float = 0.5   # peak thrust reduction (fraction) at full stagger
	# Peak edge-grip reduction (fraction) at full stagger. Thrust alone barely
	# registers on a skater already at speed — the stride is power-limited there
	# and the glide is long — so a rattled skater is also off his edges.
	var max_grip_penalty: float = 0.4
	# Knockdown: the top of the same intensity continuum. A hit whose victim impulse
	# exceeds knockdown_impulse doesn't just stagger — it KNOCKS THE VICTIM DOWN
	# (movement locked, slides + bleeds speed, can't touch the puck) for a recovery
	# window that scales with how far past the threshold it landed, from
	# min_knockdown_seconds at the threshold to max_knockdown_seconds at
	# knockdown_ref_impulse. Kept just ABOVE the full-check point (ref_impulse): a
	# full check staggers + strips, and a knockdown is the reward for a SOLID hit —
	# a committed skate-in at pace (~5.5 m/s closing, medium build) up to a maximal
	# head-on collision — not the default result of every check.

# The victim transfer-impulse the puck-strip / pickup-denial decision keys off —
# the SAME "how hard did it land on the victim" magnitude the stagger uses (the
# actually-applied |Δv|), so the transfer coefficient, both skaters' mass, and the
# closing speed all decide whether the puck comes loose. A glancing shove barely
# jars it; an enforcer strips it clean.

# Reconstructed from impact_force = attacker_weight × approach (what the
# body_checked_player signal carries): closing = impact_force / attacker_weight,
# then the delivery is the collision resolver's OWN function
# (SkaterCollisionRules.victim_kick — the exact inelastic reduced-mass kick
# resolve() applies), with the brace folded into the transfer the same way the
# resolver call site does. Delegating rather than mirroring is the point: a
# reconstruction of the kick here goes silently stale the moment the resolver
# changes, while delegation propagates a delivery-model change in the same edit.
# test_body_check_rules locks the identity against a live resolve() contact.

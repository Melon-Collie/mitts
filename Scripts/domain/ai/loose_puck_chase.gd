class_name AILoosePuckChase

# Pure-function election of which teammate should chase a loose puck. Two
# things it must get right, both of which a raw closest-to-puck distance gets
# wrong and both of which read as "bots are late to loose pucks":
#
#   - Velocity / facing. A bot nearer the puck but coasting AWAY is not the one
#     arriving first. Election uses AIActionScoring.time_to_arrive, which folds
#     momentum into the estimate.
#
#   - Flip-flop hesitation. Two near-equidistant bots will swap "closest" every
#     frame and each flicker CHASE_PUCK <-> OFF_PUCK, so neither commits and the
#     puck sits loose. Incumbent hysteresis pins the role to the current chaser
#     unless a challenger beats them by HYSTERESIS_S.
#
# Stateless: the caller owns the per-team `prev_elected` and feeds it back each
# frame for the hysteresis term. Lives in the domain layer so it's GUT-testable
# without the engine.

# Incumbent keeps the chase unless a challenger's intercept time beats
# it by more than this margin. Units are seconds so it composes with
# time_to_arrive directly. ≈ 1 m of positional difference at the
# calibrated ETA's close-range standing-start rate (matches
# AIRoleSlots.HYSTERESIS_PENALTY_S — re-derived with the phase-model
# time_to_arrive). Enough to kill frame-to-frame swapping between
# geometrically-similar bots without making the role stale when a
# genuinely better-placed teammate appears.
const HYSTERESIS_S: float = 0.2

# ── Path race ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# EVERY loose puck races on its friction + board-aware predicted path: at each
# step T of the walk, a skater makes the intercept iff his calibrated ETA to
# that point fits inside T. A current-position read lies about both ends of the
# race — the man chasing a puck's tail from a metre back "wins" a race the puck
# outruns him in, while the skater the puck is travelling TOWARD, whose true
# intercept is where it comes to him, reads as hopeless and declines.
#
# NO speed gate on the walk. A slow puck's path is not approximately its
# position: ICE_FRICTION 0.05 decelerates a puck at 0.49 m/s², so a 3.9 m/s
# roller travels 9.5 m inside the race horizon and takes 8 s to settle, and a
# bounded straight-line lead standing in for it runs through the boards.
const RACE_LOOKAHEAD_S: float = 3.0
# 0.25 s steps. The race read interpolates within the step it crosses in
# (path_intercept_time), so this is the resolution of the PATH, not of the
# answer — a coarser walk costs geometric fidelity, never race margin.
const RACE_STEPS: int = 12

# Above this the puck must be met EARLY — blade swung to the gate and the body
# set — so its intercept is judged with KILL_SETUP_MARGIN_S of arrival slack.
# Below it a skater can meet the puck exactly and the intercept converges on
# its own. This is a statement about the RECEPTION, not about whether the
# puck's path is worth predicting; see the block above for why those are

# ── Race commitment (is that body actually going for the puck?) ─────────────
# First-stride floor: a skater actually running a race for a loose puck
# exceeds this closing speed toward it within his first strides; below it
# the body is standing or skating elsewhere — not a collector, whatever his
# hypothetical ETA says. Two consumers:
#   - the election (below): a HUMAN teammate can't be assigned by election,
#     so he only suppresses the bots while demonstrably playing the puck;
#   - the chase decline (AIRoleHelpers.loose_puck_race_lost): an opponent
#     who is NOT running the race must not talk our chaser out of it, or both
#     teams decline on hypothetical winners and nobody goes.

# ── Why the `reach` argument below is for the SELF read only ────────────────
# A skater meets a loose puck when his BLADE touches it, not when his navel
# lands on it, so the intercept a body STEERS to must not charge the last
# stick-length as travel: without reach the solve pushed the meeting point
# downstream, and the man who would have swept the puck up on the way past
# instead read himself as late and aimed further along.
#
# The COMPARATIVE reads — the election, best_intercept_time, the race-lost
# decline — deliberately leave it at 0. Two reasons, and the second is the
# load-bearing one:
#   - Reach is nearly common to all racers, so it barely moves a RANKING; it
#     is the absolute arrival that it corrects.
#   - It destroys the resolution the election depends on. Every body within a
#     stick of the puck solves to t = 0, so bots the sub-step interpolation
#     exists to separate all tie and fall through to the peer-id tie-break —
#     the exact defect that interpolation was added to fix. Measured, putting
#     reach in the election left a crossing cutter unattended (D-zone coverage
#     fixture: 2.49 uncovered attackers/tick against a 2.2 bar).
# "Is this puck inside my stick" is already its own read (puck_comes_to_reach),
# which overrides the election rather than competing inside it.


# The shared predicted path for one race — memoized on the exact puck state,
# because every consumer in one AI tick (both teams' elections, each chaser's
# race-lost decline, every reach-band read) races the SAME puck: one walk per
# tick, not one per caller. Callers must treat the returned array as
# read-only.

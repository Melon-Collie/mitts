# 5v5 role-slot assignment — the position-aware sibling of AIRoleSlots
# (which stays the verbatim 3v3 path; TeamBrain branches on team_size).
# Design: docs/5v5-ai-plan.md §1–§2.
#
# Same election machinery as 3v3 — a momentum-aware soonest-to-arrive race
# per slot (time_to_arrive at each peer's real Speed cap) with arrival-time
# hysteresis — but **group-scoped**: every 5v5 slot is tagged F (forwards:
# lobby slots C/LW/RW), D (defensemen: LD/RD) or ANY, and each slot's race
# runs inside its group. Your defenseman being nearest the puck no longer
# vacuums him up-ice into a forward's job; the F/D split is the identity
# layer 5v5 is built on. Slots elect in a fixed priority order (the most
# structurally important first), and any slot whose group ran out of bodies
# — the carrier came from that group, or a human is wandering — CROSS-FILLS
# from whoever is left, which is what makes "a D activates, a forward covers
# his point" emergent rather than scripted.
#
# Strong/weak is emergent (whichever D reaches the strong-side job first
# wins it; the brain's hysteretic strong_x sets the side), while the lobby's
# L/R label survives as a REST BIAS: a peer whose lobby position matches a
# slot's home identity gets POSITION_BIAS_S shaved off its effective arrival
# time. At rest the bias always decides (LD takes the left point); a genuine
# kinematic advantage larger than the bias still swaps the pair on a
# cross-ice swing — the real-hockey exchange.
#
# Positions come from `position_by_peer` (peer_id → lobby team_slot 0–4,
# PlayerRegistry's live view). Unknown peers default to the F group — a
# rover fills forward jobs, never a D post.

# Flat arrival-time discount for a peer whose lobby position matches the
# slot's home identity (see header). Bigger than HYSTERESIS_PENALTY_S so the
# rest state is decided by identity, small enough that real momentum wins.

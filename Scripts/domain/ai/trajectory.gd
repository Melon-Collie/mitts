# Forward-simulate a skater / puck position N steps ahead. Returns
# the position at each step (index 0 = t=dt, index N-1 = t=N*dt).
# Callers either pluck a single step (man-to-man lead) or scan the
# whole array (intercept search, lane prediction).
#
# Two physics models, picked via the `decel_m_s2` and `bounce_factor`
# parameters:
#
# - Skater / generic body (decel = 0, bounce = 0): constant velocity
#   with rink CLAMPING. A skater hugging the boards isn't actually
#   at pos + vel × 0.5s — they bounce / scrape — and an unclamped
#   lead would put the defender's anchor inside the boards. Clamp is
#   the safe approximation.
#
# - Puck (decel = PUCK_ICE_DECEL, bounce = PUCK_BOARD_BOUNCE):
#   Coulomb friction decelerates the velocity opposite to its
#   direction each step (matching how ICE_FRICTION × gravity slows a
#   sliding puck), and board contact REFLECTS the perpendicular
#   velocity component scaled by the restitution coefficient. The
#   `predict_puck_at` convenience wires these directly from
#   GameRules so callers don't have to remember the constants.
#
# Cost is trivial — a few skaters × 6 steps at 6 Hz brain tick.

# ── Board-aware reception gate ──────────────────────────────────────────────
# Where a loose puck comes into a receiver's reach, solved on the puck's REAL
# path instead of the straight ray off its current velocity.
#
# For a puck in open ice a straight ray off the current velocity agrees with the
# real path. On a RIM it does not: the path bends through the board carom and
# bleeds speed to board friction, so the ray leaves the rink mid-corner. Clamping
# it back onto the ice keeps two lies that decide the play — the ARRIVAL TIME is
# measured along the chord instead of around the arc, and the INCOMING DIRECTION
# is the pre-carom one, so the receiver squares his blade to a line the puck is
# no longer travelling.
#
# Walks the same friction + rounded-corner-carom integration everything else
# already trusts and reports the first point on that path the blade can touch —
# the gate the blade should wait at. With no such point it reports the closest
# approach instead, so a receiver still has somewhere honest to aim while the
# body keeps closing.
#
# It is a RENDEZVOUS: the reach circle rides `from_vel` down the walk, so the
# answer is where the puck's path meets the body's, not where it meets the spot
# the body happens to occupy at the instant of asking. A meeting point is a fact
# about two futures, and a present-frame solve cannot see one — a body metres
# off the line never has the puck's path enter a circle drawn where it is
# STANDING, so the walk finds no entry at all and falls back to the
# closest-approach foot, aiming the blade at ice the arm cannot reach until the
# last few ticks. Against a cursor that slews ~0.33 m per tick (blade speed
# ~10 m/s at 30 Hz) the stick is still swinging when the puck arrives. Ridden,
# the same meet is available from the first tick and always sits somewhere the
# arm can be, so the blade spends the approach in the pose it will catch in.
#
# The body is projected at CONSTANT velocity, the same read `_has_man_to_beat`
# and the protect screen use, and only for `ride_s` — after that it is treated
# as parked. The bound matters because a receiver is steering while this runs,
# so its present velocity is a claim with a shelf life, and the walk's horizon
# (2 s) is well past it. Callers pass the PASSER's own lead bound
# (AIRoleCarrier.PASS_LEAD_MAX_S), which makes the two halves of a pass agree on
# how much of the receiver's motion is real: the feed is aimed at most that far
# ahead of him, so he may set up at most that far ahead of himself.
#
# Results land in statics (single-threaded AI tick, same convention as
# AIActionScoring.resolve_feed_keeper): one solve serves the stance, the timing
# gate and the blade aim, with no per-call allocation on a per-tick path.

# `gate_point` is the same event in world coordinates, and the two consumers
# want different ones: the STANCE and the timing gate are about a patch of ice
# (world), while the BLADE AIM is a cursor the IK chases out of a body that is
# still skating (relative). Aiming the cursor at the world meet parks it on ice
# the arm cannot reach until the body arrives, and a reaching-for-nothing blade
# is not on the puck when the puck comes. Held as an offset the blade rides the
# body rigidly, which is the most stable pose there is, and lands exactly on the
# meet as the body gets there. With `from_vel`
# ZERO the body does not move, so `from_pos + gate_offset == gate_point` and
# nothing about the frozen solve changes.

# Each walk step is tested as a SEGMENT, not a sample point: a 20 m/s feed
# crosses metres per step, so a point-sampled walk fine enough to never skip
# through a ~1 m reach circle would cost several times the steps. Segment entry
# is exact at any step size (the ray/circle root gives the sub-step crossing),
# which keeps the walk coarse enough to run per-tick per-receiver. With the body
# riding, the segment is taken in the BODY's frame — its endpoints are the
# puck's offsets from the body at each end of the step, both moving linearly
# within it — so the same quadratic stays exact and `u` maps straight back onto
# the puck's world span.

#
# Closed form rather than a stepped walk because the answer is wanted per
# delivery inside the carrier's compete. The walk costs ~1 us per step
# (benchmarks/test_ai_micro_benchmark.gd) and a full runout is ~270 steps — the
# same cost class as the entire controlled_space fan. Between board contacts the
# motion is a straight line under constant deceleration, so each leg is exact
# arithmetic and only the contacts need solving; a release resolves in at most
# _RELEASE_MAX_LEGS of them.
#
# Board geometry mirrors GameRules.clamp_to_rink_inner exactly — straight side
# and end walls plus the four corner ARCS, every extent inset by the puck's own
# radius exactly as the stepped sim's board_margin insets it. The arcs are not
# optional detail here: a rim fired into a corner is the delivery the whole model
# exists to price, and treating the corner as a square would put its contact
# metres away at the wrong incidence. The inset is not optional either: this
# solver's answers are compared against the stepped walk's, and a radius per
# contact compounds down a multi-bounce rim.

# A release stops resolving after this many board contacts, then finishes as a
# straight slide clamped to the surface. The cap is generous because a CORNER
# rim genuinely bounces many times: each contact there is near-tangential, and a
# glancing carom sheds almost nothing (see _bounce_velocity), so a puck can walk
# the whole arc in small steps. A cap of 4 stranded such a puck in the corner
# while the stepped walk carried it out to the far end. Even at this cap a
# release resolves for a fraction of the stepped walk's ~270 steps.

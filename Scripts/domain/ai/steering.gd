# ── Velocity-matched seek ────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# re-picked every re-eval and skated THROUGH at pace (the arrival brake skips
# them for the same reason); bleeding forward speed pacifies the carrier so it
# never drives a duel. (2) Subtracting the full velocity weakens thrust as the
# bot nears top speed, so friction drags it below max and the carry visibly
# slows. With no cross-drift the term reduces to the plain seek.

# new direction once speed has dropped below BRAKE_PIVOT_MIN_SPEED. Cuts
# the wide arcs bots used to trace on near-180° transitions (puck flip,
# opp turnover) down to a tight pivot. The engage threshold is well past

# stopping-distance law as the offside brake, applied to a point — when the
# CLOSING speed toward the anchor can no longer be shed inside the remaining
# distance, press the real brake. Evaluated fresh every tick, so a target still
# moving away never engages it and one that stops engages it exactly one
# stopping-distance out. Hysteresis: once braking, the release margin exceeds the
# engage margin, so shedding speed (which collapses stop_dist quadratically)
# can't strobe the brake key.
#
# Deliberately NOT applied to waypoint-style anchors — carry steps re-picked

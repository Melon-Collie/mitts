class_name AIActionScoring

# Pure-function utility scoring for on-puck actions. Each score is a
# multiplicative composition of factors in [0, 1]. `score_shoot` is xG-SHAPED
# (peak in the slot, fading with range and angle) but NOT magnitude-calibrated:
# read the outputs as RELATIVE shot quality, never as a goal probability.
#
# Top-level options compete uniformly, on one scale:
#
#   shoot:  score_shoot(self_pos)
#   pass:   score_at(receiver_lead) × lane_clear × time_factor
#   carry:  score_at(candidate)     × path_clearance × time_factor
#
# score_at(pos) = max(score_shoot(pos), carry_to_slot_from_pos), defined in the
# carrier. There is deliberately no leaf-pass term inside it: at depth 2 only
# the receiver's own shot and carry-to-slot are considered, which bounds the
# recursion and keeps two bots out of a mutual pass loop.
#
# Dumps do NOT compete on this scale — they are priced in their own currency (a
# concession, plus the race the dump-in earns a gain from) and meet the carry in
# AIRoleCarrier's commit compete.

# Shared read-only empty arrays for the optional opponent-context args below.
# Passing these instead of a fresh `[]` at the internal pass-through sites keeps
# the leaf scorers (score_shoot / score_pass / lane_clear), which fire tens of
# times per carrier compete × bots, from allocating an empty array per call.
#
# Two traps. They are for ARGUMENT sites only: a shared empty used as a
# *parameter default* trips a Godot type-binding error at call time, so the
# `= []` defaults below stay literals. And EMPTY_VEC3 must be a `static var`,
# not a `const`: a typed-`const` array loses its element type when passed as a
# typed-array argument (Godot rejects it — "does not have the same element
# type"), whereas a typed static var keeps it. EMPTY_CAPS is untyped, so a
# read-only `const` is fine there.

# ── Shot danger: hole-based open-net model ───────────────────────────────────
# score_shoot rates a shot by evaluating the classic goalie "holes" as separate
# targets, taking the BEST one. The score is that hole's opening; which hole it
# is decides the LOFT the bot shoots (best_shot_loft). This is pure geometry
# from the shooter's eye — distance, angle, and coverage all EMERGE (see
# _hole_open_angle) — with the goalie a body that occludes part of the net.
#
#   1,2  top corners     -> HIGH loft (over the glove/blocker held up in stance)
#   3,4  bottom corners  -> FLAT      (beside the pads)
#   5    five-hole       -> FLAT      (between the legs — opens when he's moving)
#
# HIGH holes ride the manual angle ladder (docs/elevation-rework-plan.md v3):
# the release is FULL pace and the bot PICKS THE RUNG — the elevated level
# whose set-angle arc arrives highest in the top band without missing high
# (_best_high_rung), the same read a practiced human makes. From the point
# that rung is LOW (the mid-blade snipe); in tight it is the toe, and only a
# steep ladder has one that gets up in time — the roofing gradient. A DOWN
# goalie still concedes the top band's arm extension (the butterfly's
# defining trade); a SET goalie keeps the reaction race at full-pace flight
# times.
#
# The goalie FREEZES on the shot (he can't slide into it), so the only thing
# range buys him is REACTION time to extend the relevant body part to the
# placement. The reaction budget is the puck's travel time to the GOALIE'S BODY
# (t_reach — the shooter→goalie gap at the band's pace), NOT the flight to the
# goal line: the save happens where the puck crosses his reach envelope, which a
# challenging keeper puts a large fraction of the flight closer to the shooter.
# Never budget on the flight to the goal line: that hands him the whole flight
# to deploy, and from 4 m a top-band arc passes his body at 0.14 s — before his
# 0.18 s arm read even fires — while scoring against a 0.25 s flight.
#
# Each hole reads its own height BAND, and the bands differ in exactly the two
# ways a real goalie's do — a wider always-covered CORE and a slower REACTION —
# which is what makes the loft choice fall out of the same geometry:
#   cover = CORE + EXT × reaction ;  reaction = clamp((t_reach − DELAY)/DEPLOY,0,1)
#   openness = the net bearing interval the hole clears past the cover's BODY-DISC
#              tangent cone (he squares to the puck, so the cover half-width faces
#              every sightline — sharp angles are walled by his depth), minus the
#              puck's clean-entry fit inset and the shooter's execution spread
# Aggressive angle-challenging (the goalie playing OUT for a longer shot) is not
# a constant — it's just where the goalie actually is, fed in as goalie_pos.
#
# The band cores/reaches are grounded, not fitted:
#  · LOW  — legs/pads AND the stick. The pad column alone is only
#           LOW_CORE_STANDING_M standing; the wider butterfly core exists only
#           after the leg read + pads-to-floor drop (GOALIE_BUTTERFLY_DROP_S —
#           the same gate the five-hole seal runs), so an in-tight low shot
#           beats the DROP exactly as it does against the live keeper. What it
#           does not beat is the paddle already lying on the ice:
#           stick_low_cover() floors the band by the BLADE'S OWN WIDTH from the
#           first frame, un-raced, which is why the standing keeper's low net
#           measures shut in tight — where angle compression makes even that
#           narrow blade span most of the mouth. A DOWN goalie's splayed pads
#           exceed it.
#  · HIGH — glove/blocker, NARROWEST core (held up they leave the top corners)
#           but the longest reach (out to 0.85 m ≈ glove_max_x_outward) on a slow
#           ARM reaction. In tight the glove can't extend -> roof it; at range it
#           gets there -> top corners shut. This is the over-the-shoulder read.
# Total HIGH reach (CORE+EXT = 0.85) mirrors the live goalie's glove_max_x_outward.
#
# The model has no MID/armpit band and no STATIC body-side hole: that seam only
# opens when the goalie commits an arm elsewhere. The replicated pose
# (goalie_hands) makes that condition visible, so HIGH cover races from where
# each hand actually is (_band_cover's per-side hand read) and the seam emerges
# exactly when a hand is genuinely caught low or wide — never as a phantom the
# resting stance covers.
#
# [LOW, HIGH] half-width, fully deployed. LOW must track the live butterfly's
# real splayed pad edge — pad_local_offset 0.42 + butterfly_pad_half_width 0.42
# (GoalieController's pose), the exact span the shot-outcome sim measures saves
# with. Undersell the splay and the planning model invents low-corner windows

# ── The keeper's STICK, the LOW band's primary surface while he is upright ───
# Every other `stick` in this file is LANE_DEFENDER_REACH_M, a SKATER's blade in
# a passing lane. This one is the goalie's paddle lying across the ice, and four
# properties decide how it enters:
#   · SYMMETRIC — the blade-aim solve yaws the paddle toward the threat, so both
#     sides measure identically. This keeper's stick is not the stick-side-only
#     asset a real goalie's is.
#   · NOT reaction-gated — it is already on the ice in the stance, which is why
#     it eats the in-tight shot the pads have no time to drop for. It floors the
#     CORE; the lateral push still adds on top.
#   · LOW BAND ONLY — the blade is GoalieStickRules.BLADE_HEIGHT_M (0.07 m)
#     tall, so an elevated puck clears it entirely. Entering it here and NOT in
#     HIGH is the whole point: it does not make every shot worse, it makes the
#     FLAT shot worse and leaves the roof alone, which is the band choice the
#     live keeper's save distribution rewards.
#   · ITS OWN WIDTH, NOT ITS REACH — do not feed standing_lateral_reach() here.
#     That is a PLACEMENT ENVELOPE, the furthest off centre the blade can be
#     swung; the band cover is consumed as a DISC half-width by the tangent-cone
#     occlusion, i.e. surface the keeper presents in every direction at once.
#     The envelope makes him a 0.64 m solid disc instead of a 0.38 m blade,
#     which projects over 84-100% of the mouth at every range and shuts the flat
#     net everywhere. The error is geometric, not temporal, so racing the
#     envelope does not fix it either (at 7.8 m the flight gives him 0.25 s
#     against a 0.09 s deploy — any ramp saturates back to 0.64). Pricing where
#     the blade can be PUT needs a per-hole placement race, not a wider floor.

# ── HIGH-band viability under the angle ladder ────────────────────────────────
# The four loft levels are SET ANGLES from the shooter's blade ladder

# the bot picks the elevated rung whose full-pace arc arrives highest inside
# the band at the net — top shelf, without missing high — which is the same
# read a practiced human makes. The band:
#   · floor — the PAD-TOP SEAM (GameRules.DEFAULT_GOALIE_PAD_TOP_SEAM_M,
#     0.86 m): below it the shot is contested by the pad column the LOW band
#     already models. A flat ladder in tight arrives under the seam on every
#     rung — the roofing gradient.
#   · ceiling — the scoring cavity's top (HIGH_BAND_CEILING_M): above it the
#     puck misses high. A steep ladder at range sails on every rung — bots
#     never deliberately miss.
#   · a STANDING keeper's plane — the arc must cross him above his stick
#     assembly (GoalieStickRules.PADDLE_HEIGHT_M); a DOWN goalie's paddle is

# The keeper is not a fixed-depth turret. His radial distance out from the goal
# line is a function of where the puck is (GoalieBehaviorRules'
# target_depth_for_puck_distance — the Buckley chart the live goalie skates),
# and a CLOSING carrier retreats him along the speed-matched backflow curve
# (rush_retreat_depth) until he is at goal-line depth by the time the attacker
# reaches the crease. Both are the live GoalieController's behaviour.
#
# The planner reads this as a RETREAT-ONLY correction (see planned_goalie_depth):
# it gives ground as the play comes to him and never challenges out on its own.
#
# Never hold his depth frozen while the shooter closes. Coverage here is a
# TANGENT CONE off the keeper's body, so a keeper pinned out at challenge depth
# appears to GROW as the shooter approaches: a 3 m release against a keeper held
# at 1.75 m out is only 1.25 m from the puck and subtends a wider cone than the
# whole net, so open_net_danger reads ~0 from the most dangerous ice on the
# rink. The in-zone gradient then points AWAY from the goal, nothing out-scores
# standing still, and the compete falls through to the safest option — the back
# pass. With the backflow he has retreated to ~0.85 m by then, sits ~2.15 m off

# puck's PATH at the moment the puck is there. We solve this per defender
# as a closest-approach problem between two moving points:
#
#   puck(τ)     = from + dir·speed·τ                 (τ ∈ [0, T], T = len/speed)
#   defender(τ) = D + V·τ                            (dead-reckoned momentum)

#   block       = clamp((reach − miss) / REACH, 0, 1)
#
# Reachability, never a separable "how close to the line" × "how much flight
# time" product: that form scores a defender draped on the carrier (dead on the
# line, but near the release so the flight time is short) at block ≈ 0, reads
# the lane clear, and collapses the pass turnover cost to zero. Posed as
# reachability, a defender already within a stick of the path blocks fully
# regardless of timing, while one off the path must physically close the gap
# (CLOSE_SPEED × available time) before the puck passes. It is also
# VELOCITY-AWARE: a defender bearing down on the lane is dead-reckoned INTO it,
# one drifting away is credited less.
#
# Faster pucks still thread better for free: a shorter flight T leaves less
# time to close, shrinking reach. All three parameters are physical, not
# feel-tuned:
#   REACH       — blade reach of a lane defender (stick length).
#   REACTION    — competitive read delay before they start closing (~2 ticks
#                 at 30 Hz).
#   CLOSE_SPEED — a defender's lateral adjustment pace. About half top skating

# Pass LAUNCH speed backed out of the target CLOSING speed: fire hard enough that
# the puck arrives on the tape at PASS_TARGET_CLOSING_M_S in the receiver's frame
# after shedding ice friction over the pass distance.
#
# Two corrections stack:
#   1. Friction (always): v_world_arrival → v_launch = sqrt(v_arrival² + 2·a·d),
#      constant decel a = PUCK_ICE_DECEL_M_S2. Tiny (~0.5 m/s²), well under 1 m/s
#      even on a long pass.
#   2. Receiver motion (when receiver_vel/pass_dir supplied): reception judges the
#      puck's speed in the RECEIVER'S frame, so the WORLD arrival speed must be set
#      so |v_arrival·pass_dir − receiver_vel| = PASS_TARGET_CLOSING_M_S. Solving that
#      quadratic for the world arrival speed w:
#        w = (pass_dir·receiver_vel) + sqrt(max(0, closing² − |receiver_vel_⊥|²)),
#      i.e. cancel the receiver's along-pass motion (fire harder onto a streaking
#      receiver, softer to one curling back) and accept its unavoidable lateral
#      component. If the lateral speed alone exceeds the target, the discriminant
#      floors to 0 and w = the along component — the softest catchable feed
#      possible. With no receiver_vel this reduces to w = PASS_TARGET_CLOSING_M_S
#      (the static-receiver case), so distance-only callers are unchanged.
#
# Clamped to max_launch — the passer's own max wrister (its hardest possible
# pass), or the league default for opponent threat modeling.
#
# speed_scale is the difficulty pace knob (BotSkillProfile.pass_speed_scale). It
# scales the TARGET ARRIVAL pace — the closing speed this whole function solves a
# launch for — and everything downstream then runs on the softened target: the
# receiver-motion quadratic, the friction compensation, and the executable floor.
# So a lower tier throws a puck that ARRIVES soft and still gets there.
#
# Never apply it to the finished LAUNCH — scaling after the solve discards the
# solve. A receiver streaking away at 6 m/s needs a 26 m/s world arrival to
# close at 20; knocking that launch to 0.7 delivers ~12 m/s of closing and the
# feed dies behind him, where scaling the target hands him a 23 m/s arrival for
# a 17 m/s close: softer by exactly the dial, and still caught.
# Defaults to 1.0, which is bit-identical to the unscaled solve, so the
# cross-player threat model (expected_pass_speed) is untouched by the knob.

#
# Because the airborne carry scales with LAUNCH SPEED, a soft flip is the

# closes, the puck situation turns. This is the survival function of a
# CONSTANT-HAZARD process — at each instant a fixed probability the read stops
# holding — so it is exactly geometric, exp(-t / τ). It is NOT a shaped curve; the
# ONLY free parameter is the hazard timescale τ = READ_VALIDITY_TAU_S, the mean
# time a read stays roughly valid. (A per-second form like pow(0.8, t) is the same
# model written opaquely: 0.8/s is exp(-1/4.5 s). Prefer the τ form — it names the
# physical quantity.)
#
# τ is an honest AGGREGATE, not a derived quantity: plausible physical
# decorrelation times span ~0.4 s (a defender closing a stick-width) to a
# rush-scale several seconds, so there is no single number to derive it from — it
# is the one "how much do I trust the near future" feel dial, now stated as the
# physical quantity it represents rather than a bare rate. Raise it for more
# patient play (more developing feeds / cross-ice / hold-for-the-backdoor), lower
# it for more direct, take-what's-there play. Applied uniformly to every future
# action so an on-route step trades travel time for realization decay one-for-one.
#
# Calibration caveat (from the value sweep): the unit suite guards the IMPATIENT
# edge (breakouts / developing feeds / walkouts start failing below ~0.7/s ↔
# τ ≈ 2.8 s). The PATIENT edge is pinned at the parameter level by
# test_delay_discount_bounds_patience (patience can't be cranked to "the future
# is free") — but whether a longer τ PLAYS better is a feel judgment, a playtest
# call the suite can't settle.
#
# ACTION_HYSTERESIS_MARGIN_FRAC — once a fire intent is set, that intent's
# (positive) score is scaled by (1 + this) when re-scored, so a challenger must
# beat the committed intent by 15% rather than by a flat margin. Prevents flicker
# between two close-scoring fire options during pre-aim.
#
# PROPORTIONAL, not additive, because utility scores span ~0.02 (deep-DZ escape
# reads) to ~0.7 (slot chances): a flat margin that is a sane ~10% of a typical OZ
# score can exceed the ENTIRE gap between options in the defensive zone, making
# stale intents disproportionately sticky exactly where scores are smallest. Same
# pattern as AIThreatAssignment.HYSTERESIS_MARGIN_FRAC.
#
# Applied only to POSITIVE scores — a committed intent decayed to worthless (or
# negative EV) earns no stickiness — and only to fire intents (SHOOT, QUICK_PASS,
# PASS), so the bot may switch to fire the moment fire scores higher. Raise toward

# ── The soft edge ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The boundary between goal and save is not a line: the keeper's edge moves
# with pose (stance vs. mid-drop vs. splayed), with tracking lag inside the read
# quantum, and with the deflection-vs-clean-miss lottery at the pad edge; the
# puck's arrival is scattered by more than the release angle. So the model
# carries ONE uncertainty for that whole boundary (GOALIE_EDGE_SOFTNESS_M, in
# metres at the keeper, combined in quadrature with the shooter's release
# scatter) and applies it consistently:
#
#   margin  = best_signed_margin — how far the net clears his cover edge,
#             NEGATIVE by the overlap depth when he has it covered
#   w_eff   = softplus(margin, σ) — the effective window, which decays
#             smoothly toward zero instead of clamping to it
#   P(make) = _placement_probability(w_eff, σ)
#
# For a genuinely open window (margin ≫ σ) softplus is the identity and this is
# plain geometry. What it adds is gradient at both ends: a covered look is
# small-but-ordered by HOW covered, and an open one keeps climbing instead of
# pinning. That is what lets "carry left and make him track" out-score "pass it
# back and let him re-square".
#
# Never go back to clamping a raw window against release scatter alone
# (test_shot_currency_saturation.gd measures both failures). At the Hard hand's
# floored 0.01 rad that ramp saturates at a 0.020 rad opening — one fifteenth
# of the 0.298 rad empty net subtended from the dot line — so most dangerous
# ice pins at 1.000, nothing can out-score a set keeper, and moving him buys
# exactly zero. At the other end a hard zero throws the overlap DEPTH away, so
# "he covers this now, but two strides left opens him" is indistinguishable
# from hopeless, precisely on the walk-out ice where making him move is
# easiest.
#
# NOTE this is the BOT'S decision currency and nothing else. expected_goals
# (the post-game analytic) is a separate function on the same geometry with a
# deliberately different input — a context-only spread, never the shooter's
# skill, so goals-above-expected cannot be circular. It reads the CLAMPED

# This model prices both, which is what separates it from the bot's
# open_net_danger (that one fuses geometry and the bot's own precision into a
# single spread — correct for a decision the bot then executes with exactly that
# precision, wrong for a stat about arbitrary shooters).
#
#   xG = P(placement lands in the open window) + P(miss it) × P(goalie leaks)
#
#   1. GEOMETRY — best_open_angle: the real open net past the real goalie, in
#      radians. Measured with a SHARP hand (XG_ENTRY_SPREAD_RAD): "what is open"
#      is a question about the goalie, not the shooter, and charging the release
#      spread here too would double-count it (at range, spread × distance would
#      exceed the net and zero every point shot).
#   2. EXECUTION — the release spread, as a Gaussian placement distribution over
#      that window. Geometry alone rates a deke that yawns the net open at ~0.9
#      however brutal the shot itself is, and a max over binary hole tests is a
#      cliff rather than a probability — non-monotonic, hard zero both in tight
#      and from the point.
#
# Passes are excluded upstream — expected_goals only ever sees a shot the
# resolution gate counted.

# ── Predicted post-seal (RVH/VH) — the ONE xG model, consistent inputs ─────────
# score_shoot is the single xG model, so it can only give two answers for the
# same spot through its INPUTS. The shoot-now eval reads the LIVE goalie's seal
# state (GoalieNetworkState.post_seal_x_sign) and threads it; a predictive
# caller (carry candidate, pass receiver) has no such state, and left at the
# unsealed default a sharp-angle origin scores a PHANTOM far-side open net that
# the bot carries to and then meets a keeper already walled at the post. So the
# seal a competent keeper WILL adopt is predicted here from the SAME geometric
# trigger the live goalie uses (GoalieBehaviorRules.is_puck_in_defensive_zone),
# and the predictive paths feed the model the coverage the shoot-now path reads
# live.
#
# Mirrors GoalieController.zone_post_z / rvh_early_angle (the RVH/VH trigger):
# within this depth of the goal line AND past this bearing off the goal normal,
# the keeper is post-sealed. Deliberately narrow (2 m, 80°) — it touches only the
# wraparound/extreme-corner region, never a normal slot or mid look.

# center) a keeper would seal, or 0.0 for the common in-front look where no seal
# applies. Only the IN-FRONT sharp angle is sealed here (VH — tall); a release
# behind the goal line is already zeroed by score_shoot's forward guard, so it
# needs no seal. Pure float, allocation-free — safe on the per-candidate path.
#
# Two triggers, both grounded in the live keeper:
#  · The RVH/VH zone (2 m, 80°) — the live controller's own stance trigger.
#  · DEAD-ANGLE ERASURE: outside that zone, a competent keeper still kills a
#    sharp-angle look by post-integrated positioning — pad edge ON the near-
#    post sightline, full stance span extending into the window. The shot dies
#    when the net's whole angular window from the shooter is no wider than
#    that body plus a puck diameter of fit (the puck's center must clear the
#    body edge and the far pipe by its radius). Pure projection geometry
#    (posts + the live stance span the band model already uses), so it scales
#    with range by construction: the slot and any honest mid look stay far
#    wider than a body and are untouched. Without it a close sharp-angle
#    release (~65°+, past the 2 m zone) scores a phantom far-side window and

# keeper runs). The planning keeper for a FEED therefore reads:
#   position    — arc-matched ON the receiver's shot line at the capped
#                 depth: the cap's construction proves line-arrival inside
#                 the feed's window for a keeper who RESPECTED it (r ≤ cap).
#                 Caught out beyond it (r > cap) he covers only cap/r of the
#                 lateral gap — the chord he must cover is r·sinθ against a
#                 window that buys cap·sinθ — so the arrival falls short of
#                 the line by the overrun and the feed sees a real,
#                 continuously-growing positional miss.
#   unsettled   — the race's TIGHTNESS, radius/cap exactly (cap = coverable
#                 / sinθ, so r·sinθ/coverable collapses to r/cap): riding
#                 the cap edge he arrives at the buzzer, parked deep he

#                 hands at the slide height, so the band above the pads
#                 stays honestly open — the "merely strong" outcome. The
#                 sunk hands are load-bearing: without them score_shoot
#                 prices the on-line keeper as a SET wall and erases

# is emergent geometry: the release point sits a carry-handle toward the

# the puck than one at the release — no cosine shaping. Even a blade

# Lane-clear factor in [0, 1] for a FIRED puck (shot or pass) — the
# closest-approach reachability model (see the doc-block above the lane
# constants). Public because the carrier's pass scoring uses it directly:
# a pass is a fired puck, so it gets this model rather than the geometric
# carry-path `path_clearance`.
#
# `puck_speed_m_s` is the actual speed the puck travels the segment —
# shots ~30 m/s, passes ~14–20 m/s. Faster pucks leave defenders less
# time to close, so they contribute less (falls out of the geometry).
#
# `opponent_vels` is an OPTIONAL parallel array of defender velocities
# (index-matched to `opponents`). When empty (or shorter), the missing
# defenders are read as stationary — every position-only caller keeps
# working; the carrier's pass scoring passes real velocities so a
# defender bearing down on the lane is priced as the threat they are.
#
# ── `accurate`: the physically-honest fired-pass lane model ───────────────────
# Off by default, so every existing caller — the fast SHOT lane, the off-puck /
# threat score_pass — keeps the legacy `1 − max(block)` single-blocker, constant-
# speed, ballistic model and its tuned tests. The carrier's own pass EV opts in.
# When on, three refinements compose (each documented at its site):
#   1. Guided interceptor (_lane_brake_block, max'd per defender) — a defender who
#      would ballistically COAST through the lane brakes and clogs it instead,
#      fixing the overshoot where a fast crosser read as clear.
#   2. Independent-defender SURVIVAL (product, not max) — the puck must beat EVERY
#      defender who threatens the lane, so two on different segments compound
#      (max only ever priced the single worst, so a long lane through traffic read
#      as open as its easiest gap). Product treats them as independent; two
#      genuinely stacked on one spot are mildly over-counted, which errs
#      conservative (a real sandwich IS dangerous).
#   3. Friction timing — the puck's real (decelerating) traversal, so the far end
#      of a long lane gives defenders the extra time they really get.

# ── Pass execution risk ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Even a clear-lane pass isn't a sure thing: leads run long, receptions
# fumble off an unsquared blade, a bouncing puck skips the tape. The lane
# model prices INTERCEPTION only, so without this a clear-lane backpass deep
# in our own zone scores as risk-free — and since fire wins ties against
# carry, that alone is enough to make bots dump the puck backward for
# near-zero gain and surrender all the ice behind them on the occasional
# real miss. PASS_MISS_PROB is the residual chance a lane-clear pass still
# fails on execution; the puck ends up loose PAST the receiver (overled /
# through the blade), PASS_MISS_OVERSHOOT_M beyond them along the pass line.
# Feeding that loss point to turnover_cost makes the risk self-localize
# exactly like interception risk does: an OZ miss costs ~0 (loose puck in
# their end), a DZ backpass miss prices the opponent's chance in front of our
# net. No zone flag, no backpass heuristic — the geometry does it.
#
# NOT a flat rate — pass_miss_prob() DERIVES it, since a bare constant here
# would be a magic number in an evaluator. Two grounded parts:
#   · The bot solves its LAUNCH so the puck ARRIVES catchable (at
#     PASS_TARGET_CLOSING_M_S, under the any-angle reception ceiling), so
#     reception DIFFICULTY (closing speed vs blade angle) is designed OUT of its
#     own passes — it never fires a feed that arrives as a knock-down. The
#     residual is therefore hand + luck, not the catch.
#   · PASS_MISS_BASE_PROB — an irreducible floor (a bounce, a skate, ice
#     chatter; no pass is 100%), plus HAND execution: the release-direction error
#     (BotSkillProfile.pass_aim_error_rad) projected to the tape over the pass
#     distance, which misses when that lateral spread exceeds the receiver's
#     catch envelope (its Hands handle reach). Same uniform-error model the shot
#     window uses.
# So miss scales with the passer's Hands tier AND the pass length: a Hard bot's
# short feed sits at the base, an Easy bot's cross-ice stretch is genuinely risky.
# The backpass suppression rides the base floor, so even a perfect short feed
# keeps a small DZ miss cost. OVERSHOOT is the physical "how far past the receiver

# ── Dump delivery search ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A dump is a RELEASE, not a spot: the puck goes where its launch and the boards
# send it. Both dumps are therefore chosen by searching launches and reading
# where each one actually ends up (AITrajectory.puck_release_landing), rather
# than by aiming at a hand-placed target and pricing the concession there.
#
# The two dumps want opposite things and are scored separately:
#   DZ CLEAR — get it out, and do not ice it. Hybrid icing is a race timed from
#     the goal-line crossing, so a delivery that never reaches the line cannot
#     be iced at all; a steep bank into the near boards buys that, because the
#     contact sheds 37-60% where a glancing rim sheds ~5% AND the carom bends
#     the path. Legality is bought by the PATH, which matters because the
#     wrister floor means no release the bot can make dies inside the rink.
#   NZ DUMP-IN — the opposite errand entirely. It is an offensive play (get it
#     deep, forecheck it back), it cannot be icing by construction (it is only
#     offered past the red line, and icing requires a release from our own
#     half), so it is scored purely on winning the race to wherever the puck
#     comes to rest.

# Launch bearings tried per dump, as offsets from the aim axis. Spread wide
# enough to include the steep bank into the near boards — the delivery that
# makes a DZ clear legal — and dense enough that the corner it wraps into is
# resolved. Each bearing is one closed-form landing solve.

# Launch PACES tried per bearing on the dump-IN, as fractions of the release
# band between the soft-touch floor (DEFAULT_WRISTER_POWER_MIN_M_S) and the pace
# the dumper can actually produce. Bearing alone cannot place a dump: the puck's
# runout at any pace the bot can make (100 m at the wrister floor, ~200 m at
# pass pace) out-slides the rink several times over, so WHERE it stops is set by
# how much speed the boards take out of it — and the only deliveries that die
# in the offensive zone at a fixed hot pace are the ones banked steeply enough
# to shed 40-60% on contact. Unpaced, the search reads a centre chip as a puck
# returning to the neutral zone (square off the end boards and back out) and has
# to reach for a wall to kill anything, because depth is not on its axis list.
# With pace searched a soft chip dies where it is aimed, and a rim is chosen
# because it wins the race rather than because it was the only way to stop the
# puck.
#
# Spaced toward the SOFT end, because that is where the answer changes. Runout
# goes as v², so the top of the band is a wall of deliveries that all rattle
# off the end boards and differ only in where they finish bouncing, while the
# metre-scale placement lives in the first few m/s above the floor. The full

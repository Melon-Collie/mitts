extends RefCounted

# Per-difficulty bundle of goalie tuning knobs — the sibling of BotSkillProfile,
# for the AI goalie instead of the AI skaters. Pure domain (no engine APIs, no
# RNG) so it stays unit-testable and replay-safe. GoalieController.setup() reads
# a profile and writes these onto its @exports before building its cached rule
# configs; HARD leaves every value at the controller's authored default, so Hard
# is *exactly* the authored goalie by construction.
#
# Every lever here is a trait a real weaker goalie actually has, so a lower tier
# still reads as a goalie — tracks the play, squares up, drops butterfly — that
# gives up the net and can't rob you, rather than as a dumb one. They fall in two
# groups: read latencies (when he starts moving) and positioning / save levers
# (how much net he concedes), which is what makes the ladder a real one instead
# of reaction latency alone.
#
# AI MIRROR: the bots' shot/pass scoring predicts the live goalie with the same
# read model (leg/arm delays, drop time, lateral accel ramp, arm deploy), held as
# static vars on AIActionScoring and synced from the match's profile via
# set_goalie_profile wherever GameManager selects goalie_skill_profile. Their
# defaults are the authored Hard baselines, so unwired contexts (unit tests)
# score against the Hard goalie.
#
# FIXED ACROSS TIERS: t_push_speed, the standing T-push TOP speed — no tier
# varies it, so the scorer keeps it as a const (GOALIE_MAX_LATERAL_SPEED_MPS).
# Add it here only together with a set_goalie_profile field for it. The
# butterfly slide push IS tiered (slide_push_speed_mps); the bots' shot model
# does not price the slide, so it has no mirror.
#
# To add a tier: add a Difficulty enum value, a factory, and a for_difficulty arm.
# To add a knob: add a field + _init param, set it in all three factories, and
# consume it in GoalieController._apply_skill_profile. If the bots' shot model
# reads the same quantity (see AI MIRROR), also sync it in
# AIActionScoring.set_goalie_profile — otherwise the bots keep scoring against
# the Hard goalie's version of it.

# Glove/blocker read latency (s) before the elevated-shot reach starts.
var arm_reaction_delay_s: float
# Back-door read latency (s) before the standing cross-crease drive engages.
var cross_crease_react_delay_s: float
# Stick-strip reach (m): the goalie pokes a carried puck within this radius.
var poke_radius_m: float
# Cap (s) on the grounded screen-occlusion pickup delay (worst-case time a body
# can hide the puck from the goalie before the read starts).
var screen_max_extra_delay_s: float
# Extra read latency (s) while scrambling — standing up out of a butterfly, or
# out of the play on a committed lunge. The only tiered caught-unset latency:
# merely travelling on his feet pays the small untiered
# GoalieController.move_read_speed_delay, because there his real cost is the
# momentum carried through the reaction freeze, which already tier-varies off
# lateral_accel_mps2 (worse edges take longer to kill, so he drifts further past
# the puck — GoalieController.unset_drift_decel_ratio).
var move_read_scramble_delay_s: float
# Challenge depth (m) at the doorstep / mid-range on the depth chart. Lower sits
# the goalie deeper in the net, giving up shooting angle.
var depth_aggressive_m: float
var depth_base_m: float
# Glove / blocker reach speed cap (m/s) during elevated-shot saves. Lower → can't
# pull the corner back.
var glove_react_max_speed_mps: float
var blocker_react_max_speed_mps: float
# Butterfly rebound-steering pad toe-out (deg). Lower → rebounds kick to the slot.
var pad_toe_out_butterfly_deg: float
# Lateral push ramp acceleration (m/s²) — NOT the top speed. Lower → slow to get
# moving side-to-side.
var lateral_accel_mps2: float
# GO margin (s) for the behind-net rim stop — INF means the goalie never plays
# the puck. Timid puck play is a real weaker-goalie trait, so only the top
# tier leaves the net; it also means the feature carries zero risk on the
# tiers most players face.
var puck_play_go_margin_s: float
# Reflexive leg-drop read latency (s) — gates the butterfly drop that seals the
# five-hole and low ice, so it is the single strongest "reacts, but slower"
# lever. AI-mirrored (AIActionScoring.goalie_leg_delay_s).
var reaction_delay_s: float
# Primed (quiet-eye) read latency (s) after watching a visible windup — the
# floor BOTH reads shortcut to when the goalie is pre-armed. Tiering it matters
# most at the bottom: beginners telegraph every shot (long deliberate wrister
# coils), so an untiered prearm makes Easy sharpest against exactly the shots
# newcomers take.
var prearmed_reaction_delay_s: float
# Pads-to-floor time (s) once the butterfly commits. AI-mirrored
# (AIActionScoring.goalie_butterfly_drop_s).
var butterfly_drop_s: float
# Standing five-hole pad gap (m of separation each side of center). Higher = a
# visibly leaky five-hole whenever the paddle is off-centre (tracking, active
# blade); the drop still seals it, just later.
var five_hole_base_m: float
# READ STALENESS (s) — how old the goalie's belief about WHERE the shot is going
# is when he commits to it. Distinct from every other knob here: the rest set
# WHEN he starts moving and HOW FAST he moves, all of which assume he knows the
# destination exactly. This one prices being WRONG. A shooter whose aim is stable
# through the wind-up is read perfectly at any lag (the stale sample equals the
# truth); a shooter who swings late beats the read by exactly this much. It also
# sets how fast he converges onto the true line once the puck is in flight, so a
# long shot is read correctly and an in-tight one is not.
# No RNG — the error is a pure function of what the shooter did with their aim.
#
# TUNING BAND. Measured against the height-deception sweep
# (tests/unit/ai/test_goalie_disguise_read.gd), goals out of 14 when the wind-up
# sells a low shot and the release goes high: 0.00 -> 6, 0.04 -> 7, 0.10 -> 11,
# and flat above that. So the responsive band is roughly 0-0.10 s and the tiers
# are anchored inside it; past ~0.10 the goalie is already fully committed to the
# wrong read and more staleness buys the shooter nothing. Values above the band
# are not "harder to beat", they are just indistinguishable.
var read_lag_s: float
# READ RE-SOLVE TIME (s) — how long it takes him to correct a WRONG belief once
# the puck is in flight and he can watch it. Physically a different quantity from
# `read_lag_s` (the age of a wind-up read), which is why it is a separate knob:
# tying them together means the deception window cannot lengthen without also
# making the pre-read staler.
#
# It is the term that decides whether LATERAL deception pays. The belief is only
# wrong for this long, and the arms recover in whatever is left of the flight:
# at 0.05 s against a 0.21 s flight from 7 m he is wrong for under a quarter of
# it and a 5 m/s arm covers the rest easily.
#
# ANCHORED, not tuned: each tier re-solves in its own `reaction_delay_s`. Reading
# a line you got WRONG is a fresh read, not a refinement — you are not adjusting
# an estimate, you are discovering the estimate was of a different shot. So the
# cost is a full cold read, and a slower goalie stays wrong longer. That lands
# where the measurement saturates anyway: on the corner-deception sweep
# (test_goalie_disguise_read) goals out of 14 go 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10 across
# 0.05 / 0.08 / 0.10 / 0.13 s and are flat above, with the TELEGRAPHED control
# pinned at 7 throughout.
var read_converge_s: float
# Butterfly push-off speed (m/s) — the slide to a post or across the crease. A
# weaker goalie's push is softer, so he loses the race to the post on a wrap.

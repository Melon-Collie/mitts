# How much room a carrier has to operate, and what he can do with it: the
# pursuit-evasion half of the carrier's read, split out of AIActionScoring.
#
# It separates cleanly because it already was separate. Across six sections and
# ~1,200 lines it makes no calls the rest of the scorer depends on, touches none
# of the difficulty-synced goalie statics, and owns its own constants. What it
# still borrows is named: the shared arrival clock (`time_to_arrive`), the net
# obstacle test, six reference speeds, and the puck-protect handle the shot side
# also reads. **The dependency runs one way** — this class reads
# `AIActionScoring`, never the reverse — and it must stay that way, because a
# const read across a GDScript `class_name` cycle is a parse error rather than a
# runtime one.
#
# Everything here is a grounded model, per Scripts/domain/ai/CLAUDE.md: a
# reachable set is real pursuit-evasion geometry, controlled space is measured
# room rather than a proximity curve, and the deke and brake reads are races run
# at real accelerations. Keep them that way — a curve fitted to feel right does
# not belong in this file.

# ── Reachable-set evasion (pursuit-evasion possession safety) ────────────────
# Whether a defender threatens the puck is not "how close is he" but "can he get
# a stick to it given his MOMENTUM and reaction." Each skater is a bounded-accel
# body: over a short horizon its body rides its velocity to (pos + vel·T) and can
# deviate from that line by at most ½·A·(T−reaction)² (a double integrator's
# reachable set), with the stick reaching further. So a defender's stick can
# touch anywhere within (maneuver + stick) of his MOMENTUM-projected position.
#
# This is what a pure proximity model cannot see: a hard charger's
# disk rides downrange to where you WERE, leaving the space he vacated wide open
# (beat him by letting him overshoot); a contained/jockeying defender's disk stays
# on you (real containment); a stick on the puck stays a strip threat. The carrier
# evades by placing the puck in his own handling envelope at a point outside every
# defender disk — the SEAM. Two seam reads share one sampler: the max-clearance
# seam (best_evade_point) is the honest "can I keep the puck at all" safety read,
# and the objective-DIRECTED seam (best_evade_point_toward) is the playmaking one
# — the safe sample with the most progress toward the carry objective, so the
# deke goes PAST the man toward the spot the carrier wants, and doubles as a
# carry candidate. prefers_brake_check prices the third maneuver (stop dead, let
# a committed checker's reach fly past) in the same clearance currency.
#
# The BOARDS bound the seam search, not the clearance itself: a wall doesn't
# strip the puck (a carrier 0.3 m off the boards with no defender in reach is
# perfectly safe), it removes ESCAPE OPTIONS — the puck can't be handled through
# it. So the seam samplers intersect the handling envelope with the playing
# surface (off-surface samples are rejected), and the wall-pincer humans
# actually use emerges: pinned against the boards, half the envelope is illegal,
# the best legal seam runs along the wall, and its clearance from the sealing
# defender is honestly small.

# ── The safety maps: measured strip probability over nominal clearance ────────

# tip-standard contact actually connects at +POKE_CONTACT_RADIUS_M of
# clearance. The two maps below are the measured CDFs around that boundary for
# the two regimes the #27 probe separated:
#   DWELL (clearance_to_safety) — the puck holds still at the sample (a stand,
#     a carry's arrival, a reception): contact is deterministic — the probe's
#     committed defender ALWAYS strips a dwelling puck it nominally reaches —
#     so the band is just the model's own measured crossing error, ± one blade
#     length around the contact boundary.
#   TRANSIT (transit_clearance_to_safety) — the puck is passing through the
#     sample mid-carry: the defender must MEET a moving target on a
#     reaction-delayed read, and the staged-carry ensemble shows a wide mixed
#     band — every carry at or below TRANSIT_STRIP_CLEAR_M was stripped, none
#     above TRANSIT_SAFE_CLEAR_M was, outcomes mixed between.

# not a full-window t² repositioning that reads every honest-length carry
# destination as covered near any body (the pacified carrier). The MID
# sample deliberately keeps the full-window pursuit read: en route the puck

# ── Crossing sample: the meeting-strip band ──────────────────────────────────
# The mid/end samples can straddle a defender the carry path MEETS between
# them — a pinch wall just past `from`, a forechecker met in the first
# quarter — and the strip lands at the meeting moment neither sample sees.
# The staged-crossing ensemble (probe: committed seeker under the real
# movement / blade / check_poke rules, sweeping pace 3–12.5 m/s relative ×
# miss distance × closing geometry) measured the meeting outcome as a pure
# DISTANCE band on the contact envelope's own radii, NOT a speed effect:
# every naked crossing whose momentum-line miss distance penetrated the
# stick circle by more than the poke contact radius was swept, at every
# tested pace (the presented blade owns that core), while crossings grazing
# the outer poke-slop ring escaped at pace (blade tracking lag misses the
# fringe). A dwell-time gate was hypothesized and REJECTED by the
# measurement — the naked band edges are simply:
#   core = blade_span − POKE_CONTACT_RADIUS_M   → keep 0 (swept)
#   edge = blade_span                            → keep 1 (grazed at pace)
#
# PROTECTION is the second measured half: re-running the ensemble with a
# protecting carrier (puck ridden on the handle envelope away from the
# threat) shifted the whole band by CROSSING_PROTECT_SHIFT_M — a lone
# defender is beaten at almost any crossing geometry (only a tight head-on
# meeting still strips), which is the duel harness's own emergent truth.
# The shift is a SHARED, DIRECTIONAL budget: the puck line can displace one
# way, so threats on one side get the full credit while an OPPOSED pair (the
# pinch wall, the corralling pincer) split it to nothing — the optimal
# lateral shift between the per-side worst crossings, bounded by the
# measured displacement. That single mechanism is why lone containers are
# beatable while walls are genuinely dangerous.
#
# Slow grazes ARE stripped in reality, but by pursuit, not the meeting —
# and pursuit is exactly what the mid/end transit samples already price
# (verified in the ensemble: every slow-graze strip cell reads dead at the
# mid sample). Only the window INTERIOR is sampled here; the endpoints are
# the mid/end samples' job.

# ── Controlled space: how much room a carrier has to OPERATE ─────────────────
# "How much space do I have" as a measured quantity rather than a corridor test.
#
# THE MODEL. Space is the fraction of the ice ahead that this carrier can
# actually reach WITH THE PUCK. Not "is anyone standing in my lane" — that is a
# geometry question and it has no clock in it — but "of the destinations in
# front of me, how many survive the race?" A fan of carry paths is sampled
# across the forward cone, each priced by the SAME carry_safety the real carry
# candidates use (crossing band + transit mid + arrival lunge, escape gate on),
# reached at the SAME momentum-honest time_to_arrive. The result is the
# area-weighted mean of those keep probabilities, in [0, 1]: 1 = every forward
# destination is mine, 0 = none of them are.
#
# WHY A FAN AND NOT A RAY. A single netward ray is a corridor-occupancy test:
# it cannot tell a defender you will skate past from a wall, it answers the
# same for a man 3 m ahead and one 8 m ahead (no clock), and it has a hard cliff
# at the reach boundary — one measured at 0.556 for a defender 1.0 m off the
# ray and 1.000 at 2.0 m, a 45 cm difference deciding the puck. Sampling an
# AREA cannot cliff: a defender leaving one path still covers its neighbours in
# proportion to how much ice he actually takes away.
#
# WHY PATHS AND NOT POINTS. Each sample is a carry FROM the carrier TO the
# destination, so a defender sitting between two rays is not a blind spot — he
# is met en route by both, and carry_safety's crossing band prices exactly that
# meeting. This is what lets the fan stay coarse (SPACE_SAMPLE_ANGLES) without
# leaking coverage between samples.
#
# WHAT MOMENTUM BUYS, FOR FREE. time_to_arrive is momentum-honest, so a carrier
# in stride reaches the far ring sooner, gives the defenders less window, and
# reads more space than the same carrier standing still — while one skating the
# other way pays the reversal. Nothing here is a momentum term; it falls out of
# using the honest arrival time. The escape gate (apply_escape) is what keeps a
# man the carrier is out-skating from reading as a wall.
#
# WEIGHTING. Each sample carries the area it stands for (polar element ∝ r)
# projected onto the objective direction (max(0, cos θ) — the same
# foreshortening projection position_potential uses, so lateral ice counts for
# what it advances). Samples off the playing surface are DROPPED from both
# sums, not zeroed: a wall does not strip the puck, it removes options, and
# pricing the boards as pressure here would discount a clean wall carry as if
# it were covered. (Boards-as-defender is a real read, but it belongs to the
# option model, not the pressure one.)
#
# FAN DENSITY. Measured against a 5×9 reference fan: ANGULAR resolution buys
# accuracy and radial resolution does not. Three angles alias badly enough to
# miss a defender 3 m off the ray entirely (reads a clean 1.000); dropping the
# middle ring costs almost nothing. So the budget goes to angles: 2×7 is one
# sample cheaper than 3×5 and materially closer to the reference (worst-case
# error 0.076 → 0.043 at rest, and the defender-dead-ahead-at-speed case
# −0.079 → +0.015).
#
# Known residual: a two-man wall met at speed reads ~0.2 high on any fan this
# coarse — the samples thread between the pair. That is the asymmetric model's
# structural blind spot (a min over defenders cannot count bodies), not a
# density problem: the dense reference is only 0.04 better there.
#

#   HOW MUCH to shield reads the MAX-clearance seam (no objective) — the safety
#     the best available shield buys, which is what the consumer's blend weight

#     spot, falling back to max clearance only when nothing in the envelope is
#     safe.

# Never AIM with the max-clearance point. It is the point diametrically opposite

# so the puck goes to the BACK hip whenever the shield engages and stays there
# as long as the man is live (measured: 120-180 deg off the carry line at full
# gain against any defender the carrier is skating toward). That is the "slips

# ── Brake check (the committed stop that lets the checker fly by) ────────────
# A brake check is the third answer to pressure, next to the cut and the
# shield: kill all speed so the defender's momentum carries his reach PAST the
# puck, then re-accelerate into the lane he vacated. It is exactly the
# reachable-set model run against a DIFFERENT own-body plan: braked, the puck
# ends at the physical stop point instead of riding downrange to where his poke
# is timed. Worth it only when that braked hold reads meaningfully clearer than
# the cut (killing momentum is a real cost the cut doesn't pay), which is the
# compare `prefers_brake_check` runs.

# How hard the real brake key decelerates the body — same value as
# AISteering.ARRIVAL_BRAKE_DECEL_M_S2 (kept as a local const so the dependency
# between the two domain classes stays one-directional: steering reads the
# evasion consts here, never the reverse).
const BRAKE_DECEL_M_S2: float = 10.0

# The braked-hold read must itself be genuinely safe — the same blade-of-air
# standard the directed seam applies — AND beat the cut by a real margin.
# The margin is tactical, not evaluated: braking surrenders all momentum
# (re-acceleration to top speed takes ~a second), so a marginally clearer stop
# isn't worth planting your feet for. Roughly one more blade of air.

# ── Fake-then-cut deke (manufacturing the opening) ───────────────────────────
# The seam cut and the brake check only EXPLOIT commitment a defender makes on
# his own — a patient jockey who never commits leaves no clearance to cut into
# and the duel stalemates. A real deke MANUFACTURES the commitment: sell one
# side, the defender must match it (gap control), and matching loads him with
# lateral momentum + displacement his reaction then can't unwind before the
# cut passes his plane on the other side.
#
# The whole read is the existing reachable-set model run against the
# defender's POST-BITE state: during the fake he reads for EVADE_REACTION_S,
# then accelerates toward the fake at his real max_accel (per-build caps); at
# the cut his reach starts from that shifted, wrong-way-moving state and is
# reaction-gated AGAIN before he can redirect. GO iff the cut-side point is
# covered NOW (nothing to cut into — otherwise the plain seam owns it) but
# clear of everyone AFTER the bite by the blade-of-air standard. Grounded and
# self-calibrating: an agile defender bites harder — you CAN deke the good
# defender — while a sluggish one barely moves (but him you simply beat).
#
# Durations are the shared contract between this eval and the state machine's
# committed execution (gesture geometry, like the wind-up spans): the fake
# must comfortably exceed the defender's read time or there is nothing to
# bite on; the cut is a single explosive redirect.

# re-derives the fake/cut directions from the same frame, so eval and

class_name AIPassLead

# Pass-leading for AI passers — the single source of truth shared by the
# carrier role's pass scoring (`AIRoleCarrier._compute_best_pass`) and the
# state machine's firing aim (`SkaterAgentStateMachine._pass_aim_point`). Both
# go through here so the scored lead and the fired lead are identical — a pass
# must never be evaluated at one aim point and released at another.
#
# Two refinements over a naive `pos + vel·t` lead:
#
#   1. Intercept-time solve (AITrajectory.intercept_time): the flight time
#      is solved against the receiver's PREDICTED position, not their
#      current one, so a receiver skating away isn't under-led.
#
#   2. Along-velocity acceleration only (along_velocity_component): the
#      observed receiver acceleration is projected onto their travel
#      direction before extrapolation. A turning skater's acceleration is
#      largely centripetal (sideways); the ½·a·t² term along that vector
#      aims the pass off to the side of the curve, into ice the receiver
#      never enters ("pass to nobody"). Keeping only the speeding-up /
#      slowing-down component leads the cut without the overshoot.
#
# The lead is measured from the receiver's BODY, not its current blade.
#
# Never aim at `blade_contact_world` and extrapolate THAT by the body's
# velocity: it stacks where the stick happens to point right now (not a
# prediction) onto the travel the body will do in flight. An off-puck bot's
# cursor is its ready stance, which points the stick along its travel direction
# whenever it is skating to its anchor, so the stance offset and the travel lead
# always ADD and the aim lands a full stick reach — a flat 1.60 m at every speed
# — past where the receiver will be
# (tests/unit/ai/test_pass_lead_blade_base.gd).
#
# "Pass to the stick, not the chest" is still right — it is just not answerable
# from the CURRENT pose, because the receiver does not hold it. On an incoming
# feed `_pass_receive_aim_and_steer` stands the body aside from the puck's path
# and parks the blade ON the line, wherever that line ends up. Leading the body
# and letting the reception geometry place the stick is the division of labour
# the receiving half already assumes.

# Below this speed there's no reliable travel direction to project
# acceleration onto (you can't be mid-turn while standing still), so the
# raw accel — which here reads as "starting to move" — is kept as-is.

# Lead a pass to a moving receiver. `launch_speed` is the puck's RELEASE speed;
# the lead accounts for it bleeding off to ice friction in flight (see
# effective_flight_speed). `receiver_caps` is the receiver's real attribute-scaled
# build (AISkaterCaps) — its Acceleration (max_accel) caps how hard it can keep
# accelerating into the lead, and its Speed (max_speed) caps how far ahead it can
# actually get. Null falls back to the league baseline (unwired / unit tests), so
# the lead is unchanged until a real receiver build is passed. Returns
# [lead_point: Vector3, flight_t: float] — the carrier needs the solved flight
# time downstream (opponent projection, goalie prediction, time-decay).

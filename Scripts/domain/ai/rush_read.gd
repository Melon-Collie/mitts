# The team's shared transition-defense perception — ONE read per brain tick.
# Design: docs/transition-defense-plan.md §4.
#
# Transition defense is ALLOCATED and LAYERED, and the aggression of the whole
# structure is set by one quantity every player on the ice can see: NUMBERS BACK.
# So it is computed once, here, and shared. Everything downstream — gap depth,
# whether the D stands up at the line, whether we play the pass or the shooter,
# whether the team may switch into zone coverage — reads this object rather than
# deriving a private version, which is what lets one defender's read say
# "someone else has that man".
#
# Every field is a quantity a real player perceives: who is coming, who is back,
# how long until someone gets on the carrier's hip, is everyone accounted for.
#
# Cost: one fill per brain tick (6 Hz) over ≤10 skaters, arrays refilled in place
# (never reallocated) — the hot-path discipline the AI dispatch path uses.

# ── Coverage readiness (the DZONE handoff gate — plan §9) ────────────────────
#
# "Get back, get set, THEN take your man." This answers the FIRST clause only:
# is the structure manned? It must NOT also ask whether men are already covered.
# That is a MAN-coverage test gating entry into a ZONE, which covers ice rather
# than bodies by definition, and a correctly executed zone fails it: measured
# against AIZoneCoverage's own anchors for a settled cycle, ZONE_W_WEAK sags to
# the high slot ~8 m off the weak-side winger (4 m envelope) and the strong-side
# pressure comes from up-ice of the puck. Correct hockey, and not "goal-side" —
# so the gate can never be satisfied by the shape it gates, and only a time floor
# is left doing the real work.
#
# TWO PARTS, and doctrine sets each one.
#
# WHERE: the blue line. "The transition from backcheck to defensive zone coverage
# happens at the blue line — as you enter your defensive zone, you identify your
# coverage responsibility." It is also the structure's own footprint (every zone
# anchor sits ≤11 m off the goal line, well inside our zone's ~19 m), so a correct
# shape satisfies it by construction rather than by tuning.
#
# HOW MANY: parity, not everybody. Doctrine keys the end of backcheck urgency on
# NUMBERS — F2 "backchecks aggressively until numerical parity is achieved, and then
# protects the house"; F3 "skates hard to even the numbers if the team is
# outnumbered". Requiring EVERY body was the mirror image of the bug this whole read
# was written to fix: instead of five bots each deciding it was the last man back, it
# made four home bots wait on a fifth who was late. A team-level all-or-nothing
# driven by the worst individual, either way. Once the numbers are even the home
# bodies set up and the late man joins as a layer — which the soonest-to-arrive
# election delivers for free, since the bodies already home win the important jobs
# and the straggler inherits the leftover.
#
# The requirement is capped at the bodies we HAVE (`mini`): you cannot be asked to
# produce a defender that does not exist. Without the cap, being genuinely a man
# short — a human who will not backcheck, a ghosted bot — makes parity unreachable
# and the predicate permanently false. With it, a short-handed team reads "set"
# once everyone it controls is home, and defends with layers instead of
# scrambling forever.
#
# So the read stays MONOTONE in the recovery it waits on — arrivals only raise the
# count, and the bar never rises — which is what makes a fallback timer unnecessary
# rather than load-bearing.
#
# BOTS ONLY (`bot_peers`; empty = count every teammate). This is load-bearing in
# BOTH terms: a loafing human must not inflate the requirement he is not going to
# satisfy, and must not count toward the bodies-we-have cap either. Gating the bots'
# shape on a body they cannot steer is the same "wait on someone else" reasoning
# this whole read replaced; their structure is ready when THEIR bodies are home.

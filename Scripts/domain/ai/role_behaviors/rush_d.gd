# RUSH_D1 / RUSH_D2 — the two defensemen defending a rush (5v5 TRANS_DEFENSE).
# Design: docs/transition-defense-plan.md §5–§6.
#
#   RUSH_D1 — the strong-side D. He OWNS THE CARRIER: hold a gap sized by the
#     ice remaining, angle him off the middle, and attack the moment his speed
#     advantage is gone. He keeps the carrier across the blue line (the state
#     does not flip there — see the coverage gate), so there is no handoff and
#     no target discontinuity mid-rush.
#   RUSH_D2 — the weak-side D. He holds MID-ICE and takes the mid-lane drive
#     ("the mid-lane drive is fed to D2"). On a DOWN_ONE read he is the man in
#     the passing lane; with only one D back, RUSH_D1 inherits that job.
#
# ── Gap control ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The gap is a LADDER ON ICE REMAINING, and pace is a small correction on top of
# it — never the other way around: sizing the gap off the carrier's pace alone
# holds the offensive blue line's gap all the way back to your own net, which is
# the sag.
#
# Modifiers must be able to run BOTH ways — something has to be able to say
# CLOSE THE GAP, not just widen it — and they read the team's shared numbers
# rather than each defender's private depth scan, which on a rush sees nobody
# home and disables the blue-line stand for everyone.
#
# THE GAP IS MEASURED OFF HIS REAL POSITION, never a velocity-led one. The route
# carries his velocity as a feed-forward, so a lead on top of it double-counts
# his motion: at a 7.7 m/s rush that is 2.67 m of doctrine plus 2.31 m of lead,
# 86% wider than the ladder asks for. Note test_role_rush_d measures against the
# LED point on purpose to isolate the ladder — the carrier is beaten off his real
# body, so that difference is an artifact of the test, not of the doctrine.

# The gap ladder, in stick lengths (BLADE_REACH_M — the honest physical unit,
# already attribute-scaled, so a long-stick D legitimately plays a hair wider).

# One rung of the ladder: the step every modifier moves the gap by.
const GAP_RUNG_STICKS: float = 1.0

# Backpressure that lets the D tighten and stand up (the repo's own doctrine,
# docs/5v5-ai-plan.md:548 — "a backchecker within ~1-2 s of the carrier lets the
# D tighten the gap and stand up; without it, default conservative").

# but never more than half a stick. Demoted from driver to correction.

# Closing speed at which the pace correction is fully applied — a hard NHL
# stride, so anything short of full flight buys proportionally less.
const PACE_FULL_M_S: float = 8.0

# ── Gap-up trigger ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# When the carrier's speed advantage is gone, ATTACK — close to stick range on
# an angle, skating forward. This is the modern read ("defend by skating
# forward, kill the rush early") and the single concept the pace model could not
# express: it treated a slow carrier as merely less dangerous, never as an
# opportunity.
#
# Three observable triggers, any of which means he cannot beat us wide right now:
const GAP_UP_CLOSING_M_S: float = 3.0    # he isn't coming at pace
# He just received it and hasn't built speed — the classic moment to step up.

# RUSH_D2's mid-ice post: how far off the net he holds when there is no mid-lane
# man to pick up, measured along the threat axis. Just above the house gate —

# D2 exists to take: the end-zone dot lane, which is what bounds the middle of
# the ice. Without this the pick was argmin|x| over the whole rush, so a lone
# second attacker hugging the boards read as "the mid-lane man" and pulled D2
# off mid-ice — vacating the exact lane the layered defense keeps him in. A wide

# ── Step-up discipline ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The ladder says WHERE the stand is; it does not say whether this body can GET
# there and still be a defender when the rush arrives. That bites in one regime:
# a defender already DEEPER than the stand — a D at home with the rush still in
# the neutral zone — where the ladder names a stand 10–18 m up-ice, a committed
# skate rather than positioning, so he arrives carrying a full stride of up-ice momentum and
# any cut leaves him reversing while the rush is gone (unbounded, 4.2 m/s of
# up-ice speed at the meet, a mean 10.9 m off his own net).
#
# So an ICE-FRAME approach is bounded by the speed the rendezvous leaves room
# for: close on the rush no faster than you can still be travelling WITH it by
# the time it arrives. Skipped with a layer home behind us — a beaten challenge
# is then a scoring chance rather than a breakaway, which is what licenses D1 to
# step into the rush while D2 holds mid-ice behind him.
#
# Never apply it while the stand RIDES a man, which on a live rush is always.
# The moving-frame route already regulates its own approach, so a bound on top is
# two controllers on one axis: it charges `closing²/2a` for a PIVOT the route no
# longer performs (≈3.8 m of the ≈6 m spare against a 7.5 m/s rush) and places
# the stand within 0.3 m of wherever the defender already stands. A defender
# whose stand is always where he is has no error to close, and the pair produces
# a D backing up 7 m in front of a rush for the length of the ice.

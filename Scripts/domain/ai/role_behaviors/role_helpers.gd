# context resolution. The role-specific differentiator is the
# scoring function — everything else lives here.

# ── Target switch-hysteresis ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Along a candidate argmax's tie ridge two spots trade the lead dispatch-to-
# dispatch on noise-level score differences, and the off-puck ready-stance cursor
# SNAPS to the role target (the blade IK chases it with no slew), so a per-
# dispatch hop whips the cosmetic blade. The incumbent spot (ctx.prev_role_target,
# INF'd across a slot change so no role inherits another's) therefore earns a
# stickiness bonus in the argmax: the bot holds its spot and switches only when a
# fresh candidate is meaningfully better.
#
# The incumbent is injected as one extra candidate (append_incumbent) and scored
# by the role's OWN scoring, through its own legality / anti-crowd filters — so a
# now-illegal or now-crowded incumbent is dropped rather than camped, and its edge
# decays live as the play moves.
#
# TARGET_SWITCH_MARGIN is in threat-surface units — the shared 0..1 currency of
# score_shoot / score_pass. Feel tunable, hand-set: raise toward 0.08 if a role
# wobbles between spots, lower toward 0.02 if it camps a stale one.

# of his man is one burst from being beaten to the net.
#
# Goal-side is measured along the man→our-net LINE (the projection the cover
# anchor and the threat partition use), never the Z axis: for a man wide of the
# net or near the goal-line-extended, "behind him in Z" and "between him and the

#
# The anchor must track the man 1:1. Centering the search on anything that moves
# SLOWER than he does — a man/net midpoint being the tempting one — lets a
# cutting man walk away from his check, and sags the whole candidate set besides
# (a man 12 m out gets "covered" from 6 m away). It is also the anchor the threat
# partition scored reachability against, so the pairing and the coverage agree.
# The ±3 m ring still lets the argmax shade off the body into the carrier→man

# The D-vs-forward asymmetry the doctrine describes needs no per-position
# appetite scalar: it emerges from who is physically rearmost. In an O-zone
# cycle the POINTS are the rearmost bodies (~9 m from our blue line) and read no
# support, so they respect any man who gets behind them — they ARE the last
# layer; F3's high-slot float sits ~8 m further up-ice, reads the points as
# support, and holds.

# The shallowest stand depth — metres goal-side of `threat_pos` along `dir_net`
# — the last man may take THIS dispatch, given that it wants to stand at
# `desired_depth` and the threat is closing on our net at `closing` m/s.
#
# A defensive stand is not a parked spot: it sweeps toward our net at the rush's
# own pace. A defender who charges the stand as it is TODAY arrives where the
# rush already was, carrying up-ice momentum into a carrier closing head-on, and
# the reversal costs him the rush — he gets walked around and trails the play
# home from behind.
#
# THE BOUND IS A SPEED LIMIT, expressed as the stand that enforces it. What it
# caps is the APPROACH — how fast the last man may be closing on the rush — and
# the geometry that sets the limit is measured in the THREAT-RELATIVE frame,
# where the defender's depth shrinks at `v + closing` because the carrier is
# eating the same ice from the other side. Becoming rush-matched from an
# approach speed `v` therefore costs him
#
#     consumed(v) = v²/2B  +  closing·v/B  +  ramp(closing)
#                   \_____/    \________/     \___________/
#                   braking    the rush's     the PIVOT: the stride's distance
#                   distance   share of it    back up to his pace going the
#                                             other way
#
# and that must fit in the depth he has to spare, `self_along - desired_depth`.
# Being merely stopped when the carrier arrives is not gap control — a stationary
# defender is beaten by any lateral cut — which is what the pivot term buys.
# Solving `consumed(v) = spare` for v is a quadratic, so the cap is closed form,
# and the stand that produces it is the point at which a body travelling at the
# cap would just begin braking (v²/2B ahead of him): inside it he brakes, outside
# it he builds, at it he holds. The existing arrival brake is the actuator; this
# only has to place its trigger.
#
# WHY A LIMIT AND NOT A PLAN. The cap is a function of the ICE (spare depth and
# the rush's pace) and not of the defender's own speed, so it is state feedback:
# closing on the rush shrinks the spare depth, which lowers the cap. Never
# re-derive it as a per-dispatch step-up plan ("the largest step-up I could still
# arrive set at") — recomputed at 6 Hz with no memory of the plan it revises,
# that shape ratchets, because every grant builds speed and the next is computed
# as though the body were parked.
#
# The shape falls out at both ends: a stalled or regrouping carrier makes
# `closing` nil, so there is no rendezvous to lose, the cap goes to the body's
# own top speed and the defender closes right up (gapping up); a carrier flying
# in drives the cap to zero and he holds his ground and makes the rush come to
# him. Returns `desired_depth` unchanged whenever no bound applies — a stand
# already goal-side of us is a retreat, which costs no reversal.

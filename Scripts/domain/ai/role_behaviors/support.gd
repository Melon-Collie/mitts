# SUPPORT role behavior — OZONE + TRANS_OFFENSE. The off-puck teammate whose job
# is "be a pass option AND be in a recoverable position". In the OZ that is the
# THIRD MAN HIGH of the 3v3 F1-F2-1 shape: a point outlet who keeps squirting
# pucks in and is the first man back on a turnover. In transition it trails the
# carrier.
#
# Argmax over `score_pass(carrier, candidate) − counter_cost(candidate)`.
#
# `counter_cost` is the COVERING-SET exposure (AIActionScoring.
# counter_rush_cost): if possession flips at the carrier, the fastest opponent
# collects the loss and drives the counter point, and the threat he generates
# there survives only the bodies that beat him home with time to set —
# teammates, and SUPPORT ITSELF racing back from the candidate being priced. So
# standing somewhere recoverable erases the counter and standing deep leaves it
# live, weighted by a real turnover probability (the CARRIER's live stand
# safety): a pressured cycle carrier makes recoverability worth paying for, an
# unpressured rush frees the trailer to play offense.

# Polar sampling radius around the carrier in transition — a sampling parameter,
# not a behavioral knob. The carrier's own spot is excluded by the anti-crowding
# filter; the rim samples remain.
const SEARCH_RADIUS_M: float = 5.0

# The third man's OZ station: this far inside the attacking blue line. Close
# enough to the line to hold the zone (a squirting puck is kept in) and to be
# the first man back the instant possession flips; inside enough to stay
# comfortably onside and be a real point outlet. Sampling the third man around
# the CARRIER instead glues him to within SEARCH_RADIUS_M of the play by
# construction, so no high candidate ever exists to choose.
const HIGH_POST_INSET_M: float = 3.0

# Safety-valve slack — about one stick length, and not a knob for opening up the
# offense. SUPPORT stays goal-side of the carrier so the carrier is never the
# last man back; this much lets it sit roughly EVEN with him (a weak-side option)
# without drifting into a true stretch position ahead. The up-ice stretch is
# OUTLET's job. A soft counter-cost bias alone is not enough — the pass-quality
# term pulls SUPPORT past the carrier on a clean breakout, leaving nobody home.

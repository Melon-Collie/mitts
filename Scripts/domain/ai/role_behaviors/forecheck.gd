class_name AIRoleForecheck

# FORECHECK role behavior — FORECHECK state only (opp possesses the puck
# in THEIR defensive zone). The two off-puck forecheckers in the
# conservative 1-1-1 press (F1 reuses AIRolePressure, dispatched
# directly — not here):
#
#   F2 (is_high = false) — mid-lane read, AGGRESSIVE. Sits in the zone
#     and takes away the most dangerous breakout PASS the carrier could
#     make to a teammate. Inverse pass-threat scoring, over a
#     search region biased toward the opp blue line (the breakout
#     lanes). Stays IN the zone — that's the forecheck; sagging out
#     would concede it.
#   F3 (is_high = true)  — high safety, strong side. The one conservative role:
#     the designated first-man-back if the forecheck fails. Holds the opp blue
#     line only while the shared pinch read allows it. A fixed blue-line anchor
#     is a permanent pinch — one chip past it is a breakaway with only the
#     goalie home.
#
# Nobody is offside during a forecheck: we turned the puck over after a legal
# zone entry, so the whole team is onside as long as the puck stays in the zone,
# and keeping it in IS the goal. F1 and F2 therefore press freely with no offside
# concern. If the forecheck fails the state flips to TRANS_DEFENSE, whose rush
# layers pull everyone home and self-clear any delayed-offside ghost on the way.

# How far off the strong-side boards F3 holds at the blue line. Keeps it
# off the wall so it can step to either breakout lane.
const F3_WALL_INSET_M: float = 4.0

# F2 search-center depth toward the opp net from the blue line — how far
# into the zone the mid read sets up. Small: F2 is the high-zone
# interceptor, not a second deep pressurer.

# half-wall winger), the weak-side man locks the middle lane at

class_name AIRoleMark

# MARK role behavior — the off-puck man-marker. DZONE only: the defenders NOT
# engaging the puck carrier (PRESSURE has him) each MARK a distinct assigned
# opponent — pick up a MAN, not a patch of ice. Transition defense deliberately
# does NOT man-mark (docs/transition-defense-plan.md §5); it runs lanes and
# layers, and MARK survives only as the extra-body fallback in the 5v5
# election's remainder.
#
# Net-front vs. weak-side vs. sprint-home positioning is EMERGENT — it falls out
# of WHICH man the optimal matcher (AIThreatAssignment) hands this defender, plus
# the shared cover geometry and the state machine's steering, never
# separate role code. One marker per man is the matcher's guarantee, so two
# defenders cannot stack on the same opponent.
#
# ── Primary (assigned a man) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Cover the assigned opponent, goal-side and in the carrier→man feed lane. A
# defender already skating the right way wins the pairing upstream, so this is
# pure positioning.
#
# ── Fallback (unassigned) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# No man assigned — more markers than the carrier has receivers, a loose puck,
# or no brain. Recover to the most dangerous ice: argmax over a slot-region
# candidate set of
#
#     -max over opps of threat_surface_shoot(
#         opp, our_net, our_goalie, our_team_with_us_at_c)
#
# so an extra marker with no man still races home and helps at the net. The
# search center is the midpoint between the puck and our net, which interpolates
# correctly across both states this role serves — puck NZ-side (TRANS_DEFENSE) pulls
# the center out toward our blue line, puck deep (DZONE) pulls it to the slot —
# so one fallback covers both zones without a per-state branch.

# position_potential when score_shoot returns 0 — gives the fallback a non-zero
# gradient across opp positions even when no opp is in immediate shooting range,
# so an unassigned marker pulls into the dominant opp's pressure cone instead of
# sitting flat at slot. `bases` (per-opp threats WITHOUT the candidate, in
# opp_positions order) bound each term from above — adding a defender only
# lowers a surface — so terms evaluate in descending-bound order and stop when
# the running max meets the next bound: identical result, fewer surfaces.

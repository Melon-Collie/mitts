# PRESSURE role behavior — DZONE + TRANS_DEFENSE, and the forecheck's F1. The
# puck pressurer: get goal-side of the carrier and take away his best option.
#
# INVERSE SCORING. The value of a spot is not intrinsic — it is how much OUR
# body deflates the CARRIER's options. Each candidate c is scored by placing us
# hypothetically at c and evaluating what he could still do (shoot at our net,
# or feed any teammate) with that extra defender in the way; the candidate that
# minimizes his best option wins. Both primitives are the same score_shoot /
# score_pass HE would use, read from his perspective with our team as defenders.
#
# The argmax sits between the shared closing verb and the answer: it consumes
# carrier_stand as the ring's centre and inside_dir / inside_shade_m as a FLOOR
# on the candidates, then picks the bearing itself.
#
# The goal-side filter rejects candidates between the carrier and the opp net —
# losing inside position is the cardinal sin — so the samples cover only the
# half-disc on our-net side of him.
#
# No exposure factor: PRESSURE is by definition the bot pressuring the puck, so
# "getting caught up-ice" doesn't apply. MARK owns defensive recovery.

# Engaged/closing boundary — inside it the argmax runs the full polar ring, and
# outside it the CALCULATED closing stands (see decide). Physical scale: ~1.5
# search steps, the outer ring's own step distance.

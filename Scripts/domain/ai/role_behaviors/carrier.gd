# CARRIER role behavior: the puck-carrying utility AI. Scores SHOOT
# (wrister), PASS (per teammate), and CARRY (the candidate set _best_carry
# builds) on equal footing every PICK_ACTION_PERIOD_TICKS ticks. Hysteresis
# on the current intent prevents flicker between close-scoring fire options
# during pre-aim; CARRY does NOT get a hysteresis bonus — stand-still's shot
# branch IS the shoot-now score, so it ties with fire by construction and
# fire should win those ties.
#
# This module is stateful — it owns hysteresis state, scratch
# buffers, and the cooldown counter. SkaterAgentStateMachine creates
# one instance per agent in setup() and calls decide(ctx) every
# CARRY-state tick. Mirror fields the state machine reads after
# decide():
#   - intended_action  (INTENT_*)
#   - last_carry_anchor
#   - pass_target_peer_id
#   - shot_loft_level
#   - debug_*
#
# The state machine translates intended_action back into its own
# State enum for steering / pre-aim / press transitions.

# ── Giveaway floors: least value worth releasing the puck for ────────────────
# Tactical floors, not evaluation curves. Both are DENOMINATED IN THE SEAM'S
# CURRENCY (AIShotValue → XGBaseline): an honest NHL-calibrated goal
# probability, where a clean mid-slot look is ~0.12 and no real spot reaches
# 0.5. They are scale-bound to that model and move if it does — neither is
# transferable to the hole-geometry score, which saturates at 1.0 and would
# read these as a twentieth as strict.
#
# There are TWO because a shot and a pass forfeit different things.
#
# A SHOT hands the puck to the other team unless it goes in, so what it must
# out-value is the possession itself. Read the number through the baseline to
# see what it bans: a clear-lane shot straight on reaches 0.05 at about 14 m,
# so this is "nothing from beyond the top of the circles unless traffic, a
# screen, or a displaced keeper lifts it". Both halves matter — the distance
# bound stops a CONTAINED carrier trading the puck for a point shot instead of
# working it, and the lift keeps a genuine point blast through a screen legal.
const SHOT_MIN_VALUE: float = 0.05
# A PASS that connects KEEPS possession — it changes whose stick, not whose
# team — and the odds of it not connecting are already priced by the lane term
# inside the pass score. So the possession is not what a pass is spending, and
# holding a pass to the shot's bar would veto every breakout and regroup feed
# (a receiver at centre ice is worth ~0.017 as a shooter and is still the right
# play). This bar only rejects a release into nothing: a numerical residual on
# a dead lane, never a real outlet.
const PASS_MIN_VALUE: float = 0.02
# There is deliberately no third bar for the DUMP. A shot clears SHOT_MIN_VALUE
# and a pass PASS_MIN_VALUE because each is a RELEASE chosen on its merits, and a
# release that merely ties the carry must not win. The dump is not chosen on
# merits at all — it is what is left when the carry is worth nothing and no
# release qualifies (see the residual block in _pick_commit_phase), so there is
# nothing for a bar to gate.

# ── Settle doubt: how sure a FRESH carrier has to be to give the puck up ──────
# A bot that has only just gained the puck has not read the ice yet, so for a
# beat it discounts its own valuation of every ACTIVE option against that
# option's bar above: the option must be worth MORE than the standing bar to be
# worth the puck (ctx.settle_penalty_frac = 0.5 doubles every bar), and the
# discount decays as it settles. Difficulty knob — 0.0 at Hard and for the
# perfect bot.
#
# Charge it against the BAR, never against the carry it competes with. The
# stand-still carry candidate is BY CONSTRUCTION worth the same as firing from
# where the bot stands (see _best_carry), so a handicap inside the fire-vs-carry
# compete can only be a uniform DELAY — it holds the doorstep tap-in exactly as
# hard as the hopeless point shot.
#
# Constant-hazard decay, the same exp(-t/τ) form as AIActionScoring's delay
# discount. It never reaches exactly zero, which is harmless against an absolute
# bar (an option within an epsilon of its bar is a coin flip either way) but
# would not be inside the compete, where stand-still ties fire exactly and any
# residual penalty would suppress firing forever.

# ── Release-offset sampling (shoot-now eval) ─────────────────────────────────
# The shot originates at the PUCK, and the carrier can put the puck anywhere in
# its blade's handling envelope before releasing — so the shoot-now eval samples
# a release on each lateral side of the projected puck spot (full forehand
# reach / none / full backhand reach) and commits the best. This is what buys
# the in-tight lateral finish (shifting the puck most of a metre moves the whole
# tangent-cone geometry) and the short-side tuck from beside the net. Two
# honesty terms, both physical: relocating the puck costs blade-travel time
# (offset / self_blade_speed), which extends the goalie's tracking window; and a
# backhand-side release fires at the build's backhand_power_coefficient of full
# pace (Hands un-penalizes it), so the backhand tuck wins exactly when geometry
# pays for the pace loss. Iteration order puts the un-relocated release first
# and the compare is strictly-greater, so ties keep the simple release. Sampled
# only in the top-level shoot eval (~30 Hz): carry candidates and pass receivers
# stay single-release — their geometry is a projection anyway, and the winning

#
# RETREAT: how close to the line the OZ one-way valve lets a carry candidate
# sit (see _score_move_candidate). The charged pass windup sweeps the blade —

# ~135 ms charge drifts a still-retreating body further (~7 m/s × 0.135 s).

# pipeline as everything else: a walkout spot is rink-side, so it carries a
# real shot value of its own (behind the line every shot is honestly 0), and
# the two sides then compete on safety — which is also the natural wraparound

# through the behind-net apex (each leg runs the same lane/safety reads as

# exactly when the wheel is genuinely on: the escape-speed gate makes a
# committed same-side chaser read as beaten, while a waiting far-side body
# kills leg two. Exit depth = the top of the low battle ice

	# EXCEPT: fire must clear the GIVEAWAY FLOOR to win. Firing surrenders the puck
	# (shot up-ice, or a pass); holding/carrying retains it and its optionality. So a

	# Never score the dump and enter it in the value compete. That asks a dumped
	# puck's whole future to be commensurable with a carry's next beat, in one
	# currency, at every point on the rink, and it is not: the dump reaches a
	# spot the carry is forbidden to name (its credit is horizon-capped), so it
	# out-scores an OPEN carrier on an EMPTY RINK; it wins by being the SAFE play
	# whenever the carry is contested, though the real cost of a failed entry and
	# a dump-in are within a hair of each other; and the softest release on the
	# ladder keeps winning because its landing solve puts the puck in the slot.
	#
	# Real hockey does not make this choice on value either. Every coaching
	# source states it as an ordering, not a comparison: carry when you have
	# speed and space; if the gap is soft and you have a passing option, use it;
	# dumping when you have time and space is a mistake; the dump-in is a LAST
	# RESORT, not a default. The evidence agrees on the ordering's direction — a
	# controlled entry generates 2-5x the shots of a dump-in, a dump-in is
	# recovered only 22-29% of the time, and the conclusion drawn from it is that
	# players give the puck up at the blue line too easily.
	#
	# So the question is not "is a dump worth more than a carry" but "is there
	# anything else left". Retention is HOPELESS only when keeping the puck
	# is honestly worth nothing — the strip-point-priced carry has non-positive
	# EV AND there is no drive-in to skate into — which is an ABSOLUTE read with
	# no reference to the dump and no bar to tune. A qualified fire then beats
	# the concession outright (that is the "you have a passing option" clause),
	# and only with no carry and no fire does the search run at all, purely to
	# pick the best DELIVERY. Which also means it stops running 36 landing solves
	# and two race solves on every tick the bot was always going to carry.
	#
	# Both readings of "keeping the puck is worth something" have to fail,
	# because each is blind where the other sees. The raw carry is honest but
	# ONE BEAT AHEAD, so it cannot see the entry a carrier skates into by beating
	# his man; the drive-in sees exactly that but is benefit-only, so it cannot
	# go negative and cannot by itself say a carry is doomed.
	#
	# …except in OUR OWN ZONE, where the alternative is a CLEAR and the drive-in
	# gets no vote. The two are not the same errand and never were: the drive-in
	# prices skating the length of the ice from our own corner, benefit-only, so
	# it is positive for any carrier with a sliver of a lane and would veto every
	# clear a pinned bot ever wanted to make. A carrier buried on his own wall
	# with two forecheckers on him is not going to skate out of it, and "when in
	# doubt, get it out" is the whole of the doctrine there. Past centre the

#
# Benefit = P(complete) × value of us having it at the receiver, decayed
# by `delay_s` (flight + any facing rotation). P(complete) folds THREE
# loss modes: lane interception (lane_clear), residual execution miss
# (AIActionScoring.pass_miss_prob — overled / fumbled on an otherwise clear
# lane, derived from this bot's hand + the pass length), and a reception
# strip (a defender on the catch — see reception_safety below).
#
# Cost = the value the OPPONENT gains from each loss mode's location:
#   - intercepted in flight → the interceptor's spot on the lane
#     (lane_loss_point), probability 1 − lane.
#   - execution miss → the puck dies past the receiver
#     (pass_miss_loss_point), probability lane × miss_prob.
# Same threat surface both ways, so the exchange rate is 1 (no aversion
# knob) and both costs self-localize — ~0 for offensive-zone losses,
# large for own-zone ones. This is what makes a low-upside backpass deep
# in our own end lose to skating: its benefit barely beats carrying, but
# its miss mode surrenders the ice in front of our net.
#
# Lane interception uses the reaction-window PASS model (lane_clear) on
# RELEASE-TIME defender positions (_scratch_opponents_release — current pos
# advanced by the commit→release windup), not the geometric carry-path check.
# A pass is a fired puck that leaves the blade ~135 ms after the intent commits
# (every bot pass is a charged wrister), so a forechecker actively skating into
# the lane has closed real ground before the puck is even released. Price the lane
# at PRESENT-time spots and those breakout feeds read as open, shipping the puck
# straight into the closing stick. lane_clear then models the further closing over
# the flight from that release-time start, scaled by the actual pass speed.
# Opponents are projected to flight time for the receiver's inner score_at
# (lanes/pressure when the puck arrives).
# `lane` may be precomputed by the caller (the variant scorer computes
# flat vs saucer lanes itself); pass < 0 to have the grounded lane
# computed here. `miss_prob` is the execution-miss probability for this
# variant (a saucer adds its landing risk on top of the flat default).
#
# Predicts the goalie at `receiver_release_t` (flight + the receiver's
# wrister charge, or flight alone for one-timer-ready receivers — the
# caller decides). A cross-seam feed leaves the goalie mid-slide, so the

# Is a carry candidate on ice this bot can legally stand and handle on?
#
# The front-of-net rule is the plain clamp: rink side of both goal lines, a body's
# width off the boards. The interesting case is `allow_behind`.
#
# Without it a carrier BEHIND a net has almost no representable move set: every
# local candidate back there fails the goal-line clamp, and the ones aimed out
# front prune on carry_path_blocked_by_net, leaving only the two post walkouts,
# the zone exits and stand-still. Under real pressure both walkouts read unsafe,
# so the compete falls through to stand-still — the bot plants itself on the end
# wall with the puck and gets stripped, and every attempt to work out of there has
# to be a single all-or-nothing walkout. That is the "bots get stuck behind the
# net and turn it over" failure, and it is a missing REPRESENTATION rather than a
# bad evaluation. There is no move in the search for the ones a real player
# makes back there — reverse off the wall, slide across the back of the cage,
# hold at the far post and wait for a lane.
#
# So a carrier already behind a goal line keeps its local candidates in that
# ice, subject only to what is genuinely illegal there: off the playing surface
# (the end boards, corners included), and inside the cage itself. The route to
# each candidate is still checked against the net by _score_move_candidate_base,

#   carrier outside the zone:        max(score_shoot(pos), position_potential(pos))
#
# The regime is gated on the CARRIER (from_pos), not on `pos`. This is the whole
# trick that lets the two value scales coexist without a bridging floor: a carrier
# already in the zone reads real, goalie-aware shot danger for every (in-zone,
# valve-guaranteed) candidate — the O-zone is xG's domain, a strictly better read
# than any positional proxy, and it drives the bot to the slot rather than a
# "high-potential" spot that doesn't score. A carrier OUTSIDE prices every
# candidate — including an entry target across the blue line — on the position_
# potential scale, whose closeness gradient climbs toward the slot, so driving into
# the zone out-scores staying out. Because of offsides the two never need to be
# compared: the only in-vs-out choice is the carry into the zone, made entirely in
# potential currency. The max with score_shoot lets a genuinely open entry look
# (a breakaway) still register its shot value on the way in.
#
# The potential branch pays the realization discount (see
# AIActionScoring.potential_realization_discount): potential is future
# value that still has to be skated to the slot, so it decays over that
# remaining travel exactly like every other future action. Leave stand-still's
# potential undecayed and it strictly beats a step toward the net in open ice —
# the blue-line freeze. Applied uniformly here so carry candidates, stand-still,
# and pass receivers all price potential in the same currency.
#
# `opps` should already be projected to the time the actor will be
# at `pos` (caller's responsibility — score_pass does this for
# receivers, _best_carry does it for carry candidates).
# `shot_speed_m_s` is the SHOOTER's charged-shot speed. Carry/stand candidates
# evaluate THIS bot's future shot, so they pass its attribute-scaled speed; the
# receiver eval (score from a teammate's spot) keeps the default since we don't
# carry teammates' attributes — same cross-player boundary as elsewhere.

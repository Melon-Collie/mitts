class_name AIRoleOutlet

# OUTLET role behavior — TRANS_OFFENSE only. The stretch-pass option waiting
# NZ-side of the opp blue line. Same candidate-set argmax as AIRoleSupport minus
# the exposure half: OUTLET is intentionally up-ice and accepts being past the
# play, and defensive responsibility falls to SUPPORT.
#
# Argmax over `max(lane_clear(carrier → c), BLOCKED_LANE_FLOOR) ×
# position_potential(c)` — the same primitive pair the BREAKOUT outlets use, and
# for the same reason. Every legal OUTLET candidate is far enough from the opp
# goal that score_shoot foreshortens to ~0, so a score_pass argmax reads ~0 for
# EVERY candidate and degenerates to "first in the list", blind to a defender
# standing on the stretch spot or in the feed lane. lane × potential keeps a live
# gradient out here: reachable-by-the-carrier gates the spot, open-ice / up-ice
# value ranks it.
#
# The search center is derived from in-game references — the opp blue line on Z,
# the mirrored puck X on X — and an offside filter rejects any sample that drifts
# past the line into the OZ, where the bot would ghost until tag-up.

# Margin from the opp blue line that the search center sits on the
# NZ side. Sampling parameter — keeps most polar samples in legal
# territory; the offside filter is the actual game-rule guard.
const BLUE_LINE_BUFFER_M: float = 2.5

# Inset from the rink boards when mirroring puck X to weak side.
# Geometric — keeps OUTLET off the boards so polar samples don't
# all clamp against the wall.
const WEAK_SIDE_INSET_M: float = 2.0

# Floor on the lane term so dead pass lanes rank candidates instead of erasing
# them — a stretch pass is long enough that one defender's closing reach can
# blanket the whole candidate ring, and without the floor the argmax loses all
# signal exactly when positioning matters most. Mirrors
# AIRoleBreakout.BLOCKED_LANE_FLOOR; each role module stays self-contained.

# ── In-stride rush entry ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# On a rush the staging depth is PACED to the carrier — a fixed lead ahead of his
# depth, capped at the line — so the OUTLET reaches the line as he crosses,
# moving. Driving to the line and parking there leaves the second attacker
# standing still, accelerating from zero exactly when the entry happens. The
# depth blends from the line (set play / stretch option) to the paced spot (full
# rush) by the carrier's closing speed, and arrive_at_speed makes the state
# machine treat the advancing target as a waypoint rather than a station. The
# offside filter and the body-level offside brake still keep it onside.

# Carrier closing-speed band (m/s, toward the opp net) mapping to the rush
# blend. Below LO reads as a set play (stretch option at the line); at/above
# HI as a full rush (pace the carrier). Matches AIRoleFinisher's band so the
# two offensive roles read the same rush the same way.

# How far ahead of the carrier's depth (toward the opp net) the OUTLET stages
# on a rush — enough to be the advanced entry option without stretching so far
# it parks at the line. Capped so the staging never crosses to the OZ side of
# the line (offside).
const RUSH_ENTRY_LEAD_M: float = 4.0

# Rush blend above which the OUTLET arrives at speed (skips the arrival brake)

# Pace cap slack (m). On a rush, candidates more than this far net-ward of the
# paced depth are rejected — position_potential's pull toward the net would
# otherwise stretch the OUTLET straight up to the line to park, defeating the
# pacing. The small slack lets it take an open lane a touch ahead of the pace
# without running away from the carrier.

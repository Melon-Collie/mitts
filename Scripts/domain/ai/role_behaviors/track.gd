# TRACK_PUCK / TRACK_MID_STRONG / TRACK_MID_WEAK — the backcheck
# (5v5 TRANS_DEFENSE). Design: docs/transition-defense-plan.md §5, §7.
#
#   TRACK_PUCK — F1 back. Tracks the CARRIER through mid-ice, all the way to the
#     net, then drops into low support. When he catches him he attacks the puck,
#     and he is allowed to finish a check (goal-side only — see below).
#   TRACK_MID_STRONG / _WEAK — F2 and F3. Come back through MID-ICE and stop
#     just inside the tops of the circles, sticks on the ice, then pick up
#     whoever enters their lane.
#   TRACK_MID — the same job with only ONE mid tracker (3v3, where there is no D
#     pair to split around): he holds the CENTRE lane rather than a side of it,
#     and owns whoever enters the middle from either half.
#
# ── Why this is a MODE, not just another position ────────────────────────────
# Real backcheckers race until they are back, THEN pick up. So a peer the
# shared read classifies as not-yet-inside gets NO argmax at all — just a lane
# recovery point skated at full pace — and converts
# to coverage on the tick he crosses goal-side of the puck. Never run a cover
# argmax from behind the play: its whole supporting apparatus (arrival brake,
# anti-crowd rejection, incumbent hysteresis) exists to make a STATIONARY POST
# stable, and a marker computing where to stand relative to a man he is 20 m from
# reads as lazy escorting while a human skates straight past.

# How far off centre the two mid trackers split as they come back, so F2 and F3
# recover through mid-ice without stacking on one point. Roughly a body plus a
# stick — they are both "in the middle", just not on top of each other.
const MID_LANE_SPLIT_M: float = 2.5

# Where a mid tracker stops: just INSIDE the tops of the circles, the depth the
# research names. Expressed as a small inset off the house gate so "just inside"
# is literal rather than "on the line".
const CIRCLE_TOP_INSET_M: float = 0.5

# TRACK_PUCK's target on the carrier: his hip, not his body centre. Offset to
# the defensive side of him so the tracker arrives goal-side and takes the puck
# rather than riding alongside and pushing him toward the net. Measured off his
# REAL position — the route already carries his velocity as a feed-forward, so a
# lead here would put the hip `pace × anticipation` further goal-side than the
# offset asks for and the tracker would never close to it.
const HIP_GOAL_SIDE_M: float = 0.8

# A tracker may commit a check only once he is genuinely goal-side of the carrier
# by this margin. Hunting a hit from up-ice is how a backchecker takes a run at
# the play, misses, and removes himself from it entirely; catching a carrier from
# behind and finishing is the legitimate version, and the only one this allows.
# The hit still has to clear AIBodyCheck's ordinary separating-impulse bar.

# means somebody in front of the play: unbounded, a tracker 16.5 m off our own
# net is sent to a hip 30 m out, at full pace, to become a second
# challenger on a carrier RUSH_D1 already owns.
#
# So the gap the hip asks for is bounded by the depth this body already owns,
# itself capped by the GAP LADDER (AIRoleRushD.ladder_gap_m — the shared answer
# for how far goal-side of a threat a defender should stand, the same one
# AIRoleChase's lost-race pre-contain uses). The three regimes fall out:
#   · behind him — the depth term is nil, the hip is the hip, nothing changes;
#   · goal-side inside the ladder — hold exactly what you have, give up no depth
#     to go and meet him;
#   · goal-side by more than the ladder — close to the ladder's gap and no
#     further, which is a defender's gap rather than a run at the puck.

# HIGH_SLOT role behavior — OZONE, 5v5 only. The third forward ("F3"): floats
# the soft ice between the dots at the top of the house, stays ABOVE the puck
# (own-goal-side of it — "F3 keeps the puck and all four teammates in front
# of him"), is the seam/one-timer option on the low-to-high or cross-ice
# feed, and is the designated first man back on a turnover. Design: plan §2
# (OZONE) + the appendix's F3 rules.
#
# Positioning is a small argmax over the high-slot band: candidates score
# their ONE-TIMER LOOK (feed lane from the carrier × shot lane to the net —
# the seam read), with the above-the-puck rule as a hard filter and the
# race home as the depth bound (the F3-conscience half: sag when a counter
# threat looms, exactly the forecheck-F3 read applied inside the zone).

# The float band: depths off the attacked goal line and lateral samples
# (weak-side shaded — the seam is usually back across the grain).

# Pure decision: should an on-puck defensive bot COMMIT to a body check on the
# carrier right now, and where's the body-intercept to drive at?
#
# Body checks are still emergent from the collision (there is no "throw a hit"
# action). A bot "delivers" one by driving its body into an intercept on the
# carrier at speed; Skater._resolve_player_collisions converts the closing
# velocity + attributes into the transfer impulse, identical to a human hit. So
# this rule decides only WHEN to commit and returns the intercept POINT to steer
# at; the state machine points steering there AND holds the Hit button
# (input.hit_held) — committing delivers
# the FULL transfer this rule's predicted_impulse assumes (an uncommitted drive
# lands only the passive fraction) and braces the checker against the collision.
#
# Committing is a real risk — miss and you're out of the play — so the gate is
# deliberately conservative and only fired by pressurers WITH support behind
# them (PRESSURE / FORECHECK F1), never the last-man gap defender. The three
# checks are commented at their call sites in evaluate().
#
# Build expression falls out of the impulse check: a heavy bot's predicted
# impulse clears the bar at lower closing speeds, so it hunts hits; a light one
# rarely clears it and won't whiff checks it'd bounce off. A carrier skating
# TOWARD the checker raises the closing speed, one skating away lowers it. No
# RNG — replay-safe.
#
# The victim's active BRACE (Physical, on the Hit button) is deliberately NOT
# modeled here: it only bites when the victim is committing a check of its own,
# which a puck carrier rarely is.

# Only hunt a hit when the carrier is this close — beyond it, contain instead.

# Predicted victim impulse (m/s velocity delta) required to commit. This is a
# CONSERVATIVE RISK BAR: committing to a hit means abandoning containment position,
# so a bot only leaves its feet for a SOLIDLY-landing check — one that at least
# fully staggers AND strips the puck (stagger_ref / strip threshold 1.35), with a
# little margin. It sits just BELOW the knockdown floor (SkaterController.
# knockdown_impulse, 1.6 < 1.8): a committed bot check reliably strips + staggers
# and, at real closing speed, tips into a knockdown — but the bar itself doesn't
# demand one. At the inelastic scale (a medium drive is ~0.325 × closing, a heavy
# build more) this means a baseline bot commits when it can bring ~5 m/s closing
# (a real skate-in), a heavy build clears it sooner off its own drive, and a light
# build correctly declines checks it'd bounce off a bigger target.

# PlayerAttributes
# ----------------
# Per-skater build on the v4 BODY + GEAR model: two continuous body dials
# (HEIGHT in inches, WEIGHT in pounds) plus four discrete gear slots (skate
# profile, blade curve, stick flex, stick length — 0/1/2, 1 = balanced). Every
# axis is lateral, so there is no legality beyond range coercion: validation
# clamps (coerce_height / coerce_weight / _clamp_gear) and never rejects.
# Neutral is 6'1" / 201 lbs / all-balanced, where every multiplier is 1.0 and
# the build behaves exactly as the shipped @export defaults do.
#
# What each dial routes to, and why, is Scripts/domain/state/CLAUDE.md; the
# design of record is docs/attributes-v4-plan.md.
#
# All tuning tables live in this file as private consts, consumed via the
# named accessors below — never index a `_*` table outside this file.
#
# To add a new "height/weight X scales Y" rule:
#   1. Add a table: `_FOO_H: Array[float]` (5-vec, height anchors) or
#      `_FOO_F: Array[float]` (5-vec, frame anchors lean→heavy).
#   2. Add an accessor `func foo_mult() -> float` returning `_h(...)`/`_f(...)`.
#   3. Multiply a captured base in SkaterController.apply_attributes /
#      SkaterAppearanceCoordinator.apply.
#
# Persistence: PlayerPrefs (attr_scale_version 5; older saves migrate via
# migrate_tiers / migrate_legacy), BotIdentityRegistry (bot picks),
# NetworkManager peer table (6 ints replicated at join).

# Height is stored in INCHES and is a free CONTINUOUS dial: every inch from
# 5'7" (67) to 6'8" (80) is playable. Tables are authored at 5 anchor heights
# (ANCHOR_INCHES); heights in between linearly interpolate the adjacent rows.
const HEIGHT_MIN: int = 67     # 5'7"
const HEIGHT_MEDIUM: int = 73  # 6'1"  (neutral)
const HEIGHT_MAX: int = 80     # 6'8"

# The 5 height table rows sit at these heights (inches). 5'10" (row 1) is the
# mesh-native anchor where the reach/height multiplier is exactly 1.0.
#
# The two OUTER rows are extensions of the curve, not free anchors: each end
# segment's per-inch slope simply continues to the end height —
#
#     V80 = V79 + (V79 − V76)/3        V67 = V68 − (V70 − V68)/2
#
# — so every height from 5'8" to 6'7" reads the value a table anchored at
# 5'8"/6'7" would give it, and the two outer inches genuinely extend each curve
# instead of copying their neighbours. Rebalance both end rows by that rule if
# the range ever moves again. The 4-decimal constants in the tables below are
# the bottom-row halvings, carried to 4 places precisely so 5'8" and 5'9" stay
# bit-exact.
const ANCHOR_INCHES: Array[int] = [67, 70, 73, 76, 80]  # 5'7"..6'8"

# The legacy 1..5 height STEP mapping is frozen at the v3 height set, which
# ran 5'8"–6'7". It deliberately does NOT track ANCHOR_INCHES: a saved tier-era
# build should keep the body it had, not gain or lose an inch because the range
# was extended later.

# ── Weight band (BMI interval + absolute floor — see plan doc §3.2) ───────────
# One authored band generates the per-height pounds range: lbs = BMI·in²/703.
#
# CALIBRATION (2026-07, against a 46-player listed-height/weight sample of the
# current NHL). Two things the sample settles:
#
#   • BMI IS the right normalizer. Regressing ln(weight) on ln(height) over the
#     sample gives an exponent of 2.01 — h² on the nose — and BMI itself has no
#     usable drift with height (+0.007 BMI/inch). So the band is a horizontal
#     interval, NOT a height-tilted one: mean BMI 26.05, SD 1.61.
#
#   • The LEAN edge cannot be one ratio. A single BMI floor gets set by what
#     SHORT players can get away with, because their lower tail is truncated by
#     an ABSOLUTE mass floor (Lane Hutson at 5'9"/162 is the lightest body in
#     the league) rather than by a ratio: you have to survive contact against
#     200-lb bodies, and that bound is in pounds, not in BMI. Tall players are
#     nowhere near that floor, so their real lower tail runs much leaner — a
#     flat 24.0 puts 6'4" at 197 lb and forbids two actual 6'4" NHL defensemen
#     (Noah Dobson 195, Sam Rinzel 194). So the model says what the bodies say:
#     a RATIO ceiling (carrying fat costs skating) and an ABSOLUTE floor (you
#     cannot be too light to play), and the band is their overlap.
#
# WHERE THE TWO FLOORS SIT. They are independent levers covering different
# heights, and each is fitted to the tail it actually governs:
#
#   • The RATIO floor (23.0) governs 5'11" and up, and is set just under the
#     leanest real bodies there — Reichel (6'0"/170 = 23.05) and Ehlers
#     (6'0"/172 = 23.32) at the low end, then a dense 23.6–23.9 cluster
#     (Rinzel, Dobson, K. Johnson, Pettersson, Edvinsson). It puts 6'4" at
#     189, clearing Dobson 195 / Rinzel 194.
#   • The ABSOLUTE floor (162) governs 5'7"–5'10", where the ratio floor falls
#     to 147–160 and stops meaning anything. 162 IS the lightest player in the
#     NHL (Lane Hutson, 5'9"), i.e. "you cannot be lighter than the lightest
#     man who has ever held the job." The lightest bodies at the neighbouring
#     short heights — Stankoven 5'8"/165, Garland 5'10"/165 — clear it by 3.
#
# The band edge landing exactly on one player is the shape of a fitted edge,
# not a defect: the 29.0 ceiling lands exactly on Kaprizov (5'10"/202) the
# same way.
#
# The band is deliberately ASYMMETRIC about MEDIUM (3.0 BMI lean-side vs 2.5
# heavy-side): the empirical center sits at 26.05, but MEDIUM is pinned to the
# canonical 6'1"/201 NHL-average frame because that is the game's neutral
# identity — every @export default is authored there. frame_t() is piecewise
# about MEDIUM so the neutral still lands on exactly 0.5 and the frame anchors
# stay evenly spaced in frame-t (which is the axis the _f() tables index).
#
# Calibration namechecks: neutral = 6'1"/201 (NHL-average build); McDavid
# (6'1"/194) lean-mid; Dobson/Rinzel (6'4"/195, 194) ≈ 6'4"-LEAN; DeBrincat
# (5'8"/180) ≈ SOLID; Kaprizov (5'10"/202) = 5'10"-HEAVY exactly; Tage Thompson

# BLADE CURVE — three house patterns modeled on hockey's most-played real
# blades: M88 (closed slot — the P88-like mid curve), M92 (balanced — the
# P92-like mid-toe all-rounder, the neutral row), M28 (open — the P28-like
# open toe hook). The ANGLE LADDER is the elevation lever (the manual
# contact-point model — docs/elevation-rework-plan.md v3): each loft level is
# a set launch angle from this pattern's ladder, steeper on the open blade at
# every rung.
#
# THE LEVEL NAMES THE SHOT; THE GEAR NAMES THE RANGE. Each level targets a
# GOALIE-POSTURE landmark — absolute heights off the ice, not fractions of the
# net — and each gear places those same three shots at its own HOME RANGE:
#
#   level        target        what it beats
#   LOW  (35%)   0.41 m        over the butterfly pad (0.28), UNDER his hands
#   MID  (60%)   0.70 m        the armpit — OVER his committed hands (0.49)
#   HIGH (85%)   0.99 m        upstairs — over the standing pad seam (0.86)
#
#   gear   home    ladder
#   M88    8.5 m   the range blade — peaks in the high slot / long range
#   M92    6.0 m   the all-rounder — 3 shots from the slot out to long range
#   M28    4.5 m   the close blade — peaks in the slot, owns the crease
#
# (Percentages are of the 1.17 m scoring cavity, a naming convenience only —
# what the rungs actually clear is the goalie's equipment, whose heights are
# absolute. See GoalieAnatomy for the pad/hand/torso boxes those come from.)
#
# Away from home the menu slides rather than breaking: one zone out a gear
# keeps two shots, two zones out one. Nobody gets the full menu at the point,
# which is deliberate — a point shot only has to reach the net, not pick a
# corner (the whole net is a 3.4° window at 19 m, so no ladder could).
#
# Two properties fall out of anchoring the fans close in rather than at range,
# and both are load-bearing:
#   · BUILD TOLERANCE. Build variance lives entirely in the gravity drop
#     (~d²/v²), so the ±17% shot-power spread moves arrival by only ±3–12 cm
#     at these home ranges — a fan anchored at 15–22 m instead would spread it
#     ±60 cm and need normalizing. Every build keeps its full menu at home; the
#     lone casualty is a weak build's M88 LOW, which lands under the pad.
#   · THE SLAPPER NEEDS NO SEPARATE LADDER. Its extra pace costs ~5 cm of drop
#     at home range, so the same rungs ride about one notch higher. Real, and
#     small enough that the level still means what it means.
# NO rung sails on a wrister, and no LOW rung sails even off a max slapper
# (apexes 0.62 / 0.75 / 1.01 m by gear) — the flat bottom of every ladder is
# the universally safe shot.
#
# The rest of the identity triangle, all lateral trades about the M92:
#   M88 — the playmaker/point blade: best backhand, +3% slapper (a flatter
#         face stays square through the heel-contact sweep), and catches the
#         hardest feeds (+7% reception ceiling — the flat blade cradles).
#   M28 — the in-tight blade: the open toe is its whole (large) upside;
#         it pays the deepest backhand penalty, −3% slapper, and hard feeds
#         bounce off (−7% reception). Its stored quick-release runway lean
#         goes live when the wrister travel gate unfreezes.
# Backhand relief approaches but never reaches forehand parity
# (0.75 base × 1.08 = 0.81). Reception lean scales the deflect ceiling +
# alignment bonus at the decision sites (PuckReceptionRules callers) — never
# pickup_max_speed, so soft passes settle on every blade and the client's

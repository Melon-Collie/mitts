# The lower-body skeleton and the gait written onto it.
#
# Both legs are one skinned mesh on the body skeleton, fourteen bones in the
# chain Hips → Leg → Shin (see SkaterMeshBuilder.LegBone). Bone indices here are
# LegBone values; the skeleton holds them past the upper bones, at _OFFSET. Twelve of the bones
# carry geometry; the four pivots exist to be rotated by the gait
# (SkaterSkatingCoordinator).
#
# Pose = basis · scale, at position, each part stored separately: `_basis` is the
# authored rest rotation (constant for the twelve geometry bones; the four pivots
# are rewritten by set_swing), `_scale` and `_pos` are the sizing seam's.
#
# Also the source of the ice VFX's two reads — where a skate is being DRAWN and
# how hard its edge is loaded — because both are properties of this skeleton and
# of nothing else.

# out of vertical — the shot block's extended leg — swings its blade up onto an
# edge and clear of the ice, and a shin folded far back — the faceoff centre's
# deep sit — stands it on its heel. A real ankle gives that back, which is what
# lets a player hold either pose on a flat blade.

# chain: the splay is taken at the hip, ahead of a knee fold that can pass 90°,

# ankle owns. The give-back is the chain's own rotation inverted, which is exact
# at any depth — and needs nothing passed in, since set_swing just wrote it.

# Low-poly faceted geometry for the skater. Cosmetic only — gameplay reads the
# Marker3D anchors and collision shapes, never these meshes.
#
# The two skinned meshes it assembles are shared_upper_skin_mesh (UpperBone /
# UpperSurface) and shared_leg_skin_mesh (LegBone / LegSurface). Every mesh here
# is cached and shared by the whole roster — per-skater colour is a surface
# override, per-build sizing rides the scale in a bone's pose — so nothing is
# ever mutated per instance.
#
# UV layouts replicate the Godot primitives they replace, because
# SkaterUniformCoordinator paints against those exact conventions:
#   - Lathed (cylinder-style) parts: side U wraps from +Z toward +X with the
#     side occupying V ∈ [0, 0.5] top→bottom; the top cap disk lands in the
#     U ∈ [0, 0.5], V ∈ [0.5, 1] quadrant (where the jersey yoke paints), the
#     bottom cap in U ∈ [0.5, 1] of the same half.
#   - Ball (sphere-style) parts: equirect, U from +Z toward +X, V from 0 at
#     the top pole to 1 at the bottom (where the shoulder-number decal paints).
# Change a painter convention there and the matching generator here together.
#
# Everything is flat-shaded (smooth_group(-1)) — the faceting IS the art
# style; per-face normals are what make the shaped silhouettes read.

# Profiles are (y, radius) stations top→bottom in the part's mesh-local frame,
# spanning the same envelope as the primitive each replaces (heights and radii
# from Scenes/Skater.tscn) so nothing pokes through ice, boards, or gear that
# was tuned around the primitive silhouettes.

# streaking receiver arrives soft while charging into the same pass steepens
# it, and retreating with a hard shot cushions it under the ceiling. Calibrated
# to real reception, not backwards from game pass speeds (rationale + force
# math on PuckReceptionRules.should_receive): 22 ≈ 49 mph closing catches at
# ANY blade angle — every pass-shaped launch (snap 14, AI arrival target 21.5,
# soft-sweep wristers) catches for a static or retreating receiver, and only
# sprinting head-on INTO a hard feed pushes past it. The alignment bonus
# extends the ceiling to 30 m/s (~67 mph closing) for a perfectly squared

# Passive-blade deflection via a normal/tangential decomposition (see
# PuckCollisionRules.deflect_velocity). The component INTO the blade face rebounds
# with a restitution; the component ALONG the face (a glance) is preserved. From
# one model this yields both real outcomes: a SQUARE hit off a hard puck dies in
# front (a bobble — see bobble_speed_threshold), while a GLANCING hit keeps its
# pace and only bends its line (a true tip/redirect). No angle cap is needed — the
# only way to reverse the puck is a square hit, and a square hard hit is killed by
# the low restitution, so there is no fast carom to clamp.
#   restitution eases from the soft/slow value toward the hard value as puck speed
#   climbs to deflect_speed_ref, so a squared blade smothers a slapper instead of
#   pinballing it. The falloff SHAPE is measured reality: puck COR decreases

#   room temp) and frozen game-temp pucks plateau near 0.27 (WSU Sports Science

#   lerp evaluates to ≈0.27 right at deflect_min_speed — matching the frozen-puck

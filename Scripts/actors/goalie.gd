# `_block_arm` is the root of the blocker-hand assembly: blocker pad + stick
# (shaft, paddle, blade) all rigidly attached. Driven by a single transform
# (`blocker_pos` + `blocker_rot` from the body config). The stick geometry
# is baked into the mesh layout — different states get the blade in the right
# place via different blocker rotations, not by tracking the blade
# independently. The Blocker pad and Stick are SEPARATE child StaticBody3Ds
# under BlockArm — the analytic save resolver identifies the struck part BY NODE
# NAME (Puck._classify_save_part → GoalieSaveRules.SavePart), so a pad rebound and
# a stick rebound have to be two nodes. They share the BlockArm transform.

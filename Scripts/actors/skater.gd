# ── Blade Tuning ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Resting blade tilt, applied to the blade *mesh* only — never the Blade marker
# the puck-contact math reads (set_blade_position / get_blade_contact_global).
# Toe-lift (about X, the lie angle) is handedness-neutral and kept small; the
# face-open loft (axial twist about the hosel line) is a tiny resting cup and
# flips sign with handedness, since the forehand face is on opposite sides for
# L/R shots.

# Rigid shaft-follow pitch (see _apply_blade_tilt): the blade mesh pitches by
# (blade_lie_deg − live shaft angle), so it stays rigidly attached to the shaft
# through every pose — toe-up through the slapshot wind-up and stick lifts,
# a slight toe-drag dig when the cursor pulls the blade in close. The clamps
# bound the read: the dig floor keeps the toe from visibly stabbing through
# the ice, the ceiling caps the wind-up apex just past shaft-aligned.

# Toe-drag read. The shaft only steepens past its lie in TopHandIK's CLOSE
# regime (the hand rising to shorten the stick's horizontal run) — in the FAR
# regime the hand rides at rest height and the shaft holds the lie exactly, so
# the factor is identically 0 there. Onset is ~6° past the lie (blade ≈ 0.87 m
# from the shoulder); full at the dig clamp (≈ 0.65 m), holding full from there
# down to the hand_y_max floor (≈ 0.28 m). Carry-only: the wrists roll the
# face CLOSED over the puck (signed against the elevation scoop, so a drag
# visibly cups where a loft opens) and curl the toe in around it (the
# axial-twist sweep).

# shoulder rather than a point 5 cm below it. Vertical drop from shoulder to
# hand at rest = shoulder_height − hand_rest_y (mesh-native 0.40 − (−0.10) =
# 0.50 m; both scale with build height in apply_attributes, so the drop is
# 0.50 m × height_mult). That drop is subtracted inside the derived backhand ROM
# (SkaterController.apply_attributes: reach = sqrt(arm_eff² − drop²)), so the
# hand can never be placed beyond the arm's length — raising this shrinks
# flat-footed reach; the directional reach lean (SkaterPoseCoordinator) buys
# it back by tilting the whole frame toward the target.

# Blade length (heel to toe). The Blade Marker3D represents the heel (where

# ── Stickhandling push model (docs/stickhandling-push-model-plan.md) ──────────
# The blade renders on the side of the puck it is PUSHING from — the side
# opposite the puck's motion in the carrier's frame — and inward pulls play
# the toe-drag / heel-cradle grammar. All keyed off blade velocity relative to
# the body, which every peer derives from the replicated pose, so the strokes
# read identically across the lobby with no wire field.
#
# Lateral stroke speed (m/s in the carrier's frame) that flips the pushing
# face. Below it the blade cradles on its current side; the threshold doubles
# as the flip hysteresis, since re-flipping takes a genuine opposite stroke
# back above the same bar. Sized well above interpolation noise and well
# under a deliberate dangle stroke.
var carry_flip_speed: float = 0.8

var carry_gesture_ease: float = 8.0
# Duration (s) of one transit hop. A flip that arrives while a hop is still
# in flight rides it out rather than restarting, so a fast dangle bounces
# once per stroke instead of hovering mid-air (the plan's trap #2).
# Deliberately LONGER than the smoothed side factor's flip traverse
# (~2 / carry_side_lerp_speed ≈ 0.17 s): the blade crosses at the same speed

# ── Catch/release blade geometry (mesh-only, like the wrister address) ────────
# The visible blade slides along its own heel→toe axis so each stroke reads as
# real contact prosody: a hard push rolls the puck out toward the TOE (the toe
# is the last point of contact of every real stroke, so flips — which only
# happen mid-stroke — release off the toe automatically), and the far face
# lands HEEL-first and rolls back to the carry seat. Pure blade-mesh offsets
# (_apply_blade_tilt): the puck stays bound to the cursor, and the marker the
# gameplay reads is untouched.
#
# Toe-ward ride at full stroke speed, as a fraction of blade_length; ramps in

# machine's own attach path (trigger_reception_cushion) with the puck's
# velocity relative to the receiver; the give scales with the SQUARE of that
# closing speed (stopping distance under a constant absorb force ∝ v², the
# same hands-soak model PuckReceptionRules is calibrated on), so a
# walking-pace pickup gives essentially nothing and a full-pace feed reads as
# a real corral. One continuous model — there is deliberately no separate

# ── Arm Tuning ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Two-bone arm IK: shoulder → elbow → top_hand. ROM is derived from these
# values in SkaterController.apply_attributes: the forehand cap is anatomical
# (cross-body reach, arm × 0.5625) and the backhand cap is chain-derived
# (sqrt(arm_eff² − shoulder-to-hand drop²)), so no reachable hand target ever
# exceeds the arm's length — the forearm never draws stretched.
# 0.33 per segment ≈ real shoulder→elbow and elbow→fist-center at the mesh's
# native 5'10" — the distal bone ends at the FIST, so it carries the hand's
# length too, which is also why the two split evenly. One arm = 0.70 m; with the
# shoulder caps at ±0.22 that is a wingspan ≈ 1.84 m on a 1.78 m body, ~103% of

# Vertex-shader shaft bow (Shaders/stick_flex.gdshader), driven entirely from
# replicated fields (current_shot_state + shot_charge) and the stick's own
# rendered pose, so every machine renders identical flex with no controller
# plumbing and no network state. The shader displaces vertices BETWEEN the

var weight: float = 1.0
# Fraction of closing momentum the inelastic resolver transfers on a committed

# equal mass the victim's knockback is closing × transfer × 0.5, so this is the
# master "how hard does a check hit" dial: raising it strips/staggers/knocks-down
# at lower closing speeds AND deepens the attacker's own inelastic decel (the
# symmetric exchange — a real check costs the checker some speed too). Scaled

# kink and the shaft never swings when a dressing engages. Do not rotate these
# angles about a heel-local axis instead — that drags the tip off the shaft line
# by up to a few cm at full toe drag. The
# twist also sweeps the toe horizontally (~7 cm at 20°) — the drag curl the
# overhead camera reads. The one remaining junction bend is the follow-pitch
# clamp at its floor/ceiling, which is deliberate (the dig floor keeps the toe
# out of the ice).
# The mesh is heel-origin (StickBladeMeshBuilder), so the rotation pivots
# about the heel and the shaft→blade junction stays pinned at any pitch.

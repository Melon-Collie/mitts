extends Camera3D

# Cinematic side-rail camera for goal replays (and future spectator slots).
# Sits outside the boards on the +X side, tracks a target (puck) along Z, and
# smoothly looks at it. activate() saves the current camera and takes over;
# deactivate() restores it.

@export var look_speed: float = 7.0    # rotation slerp speed

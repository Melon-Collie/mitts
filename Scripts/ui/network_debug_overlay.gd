class_name NetworkDebugOverlay
extends CanvasLayer

# F3 network debug overlay. Reads NetworkTelemetry + NetworkManager and renders a
# role-aware, color-coded health readout. Design notes:
#   • Each metric is colored green / yellow / red by comparing the live value to
#     the healthy ranges documented in network_telemetry.gd — the at-a-glance
#     "expected vs unexpected" signal the raw numbers do not carry.
#   • The header verdict (OK / WATCH / PROBLEM) must mean "something is actually
#     WRONG", so only ACTUAL-PROBLEM metrics drive it (via _metric); connection
#     FACTS are colored for context but verdict-neutral (via _context, see there).
#   • Every line carries an inline plain-English hint (what it means + the target
#     range) so the overlay is self-explanatory without a separate cheat sheet.
#   • Sections are gated by role (SOLO / HOST / CLIENT): a client never sees
#     host-frame stats that would read as misleading zeros, and vice-versa.
#   • "Watch" metrics (stick jumps, puck snaps, reorders, reconcile match) stay
#     hidden while healthy and surface only when they cross a threshold, so the
#     overlay stays calm until something actually needs attention. They are
#     calibrated to NOT fire on normal play (e.g. fast stickhandling is not a
#     "stick jump") — a visible flag means a real anomaly, not a false alarm.
# Health bands come from NetworkTelemetry (RECONCILE_*, EXTRAPOLATION_*, STALL_*,
# STARVATION_*, PUCK_SNAP_*), which is also what the auto-marker tripwires fire
# on — so a red metric here and a recorded marker cannot disagree.

# ── Sim / render phase ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The sim integrates at a fixed Constants.PHYSICS_TICK while GameCamera, which
# smooths in _process, moves continuously at the render rate. Without physics
# interpolation an actor's RENDERED position is quantized to the tick: within one
# tick the camera slides a full step and the skater does not, then the skater
# jumps the whole step at once — a sawtooth in the skater's SCREEN position, one
# tick of travel from end to end. The panel reports the interpolation state
# alongside the pattern, since that is what decides whether it matters.
#
# Whether that sawtooth is visible is purely a sampling question. Rendered motion
# is smooth only when every frame advances the sim by the same whole number of
# ticks, which needs the frame rate to DIVIDE the tick rate — 120, 60, 40, 30
# against a 120 Hz sim, where each frame samples the sawtooth at the same phase
# and it aliases away entirely. Any other rate samples it mid-sweep. Note the
# direction of that test: 240 fps is not a clean multiple but the worst case,
# because half its frames advance no tick at all.
#
# This section reports the tick/frame pattern directly rather than inferring it
# from the frame rate: vsync, frame pacing, and a busy tick all bend the pattern
# away from what fps ÷ tick rate predicts.

#   • CPU render — the render thread turning the visible scene into draw

#                  not their size, and every shadow-casting light re-submits the
#                  casters in its range. A hundred small MeshInstance3Ds cost
#                  here, not on the GPU.
#   • Script     — _process + _physics_process on the main thread. At a 120 Hz
#                  sim, roughly one physics tick runs inside every rendered
#                  frame, so per-tick work is charged straight to frame time.

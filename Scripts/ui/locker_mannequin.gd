# The locker's display figure: a full kit-dressed skater assembled from the
# rink's own shared part meshes, standing on the case floor with the picked
# stick in both hands. Every piece the locker edits is worn HERE — skates on
# the feet, gloves gripping the shaft, face gear in the helmet — so a pick is
# judged in the place it will actually be seen.
#
# Built from the individual part meshes rather than the skinned rig. That costs
# nothing in fidelity: `shared_torso()` and the skinned mesh's torso surface are
# the same cached `_shared("torso", ...)` geometry, so the silhouette is
# identical while the pose stays plain node transforms — no Skeleton3D, no bone
# poses, no gait. The lobby's bench dummies are assembled the same way.
#
# Frame: the rest positions below are Scenes/Skater.tscn's, in MeshRoot-local
# coordinates, so the figure is laid out in the rig's own numbers and faces −Z
# like the rig does. `_rig` is then seated so the blade contact lands on THIS
# node's origin — y = 0 is the ice, whatever the build's height.
#
# Body dials scale the rig about that ice plane, mirroring
# SkaterAppearanceCoordinator's rule: every Y offset rides the height
# multiplier, each part's lateral scale rides its own bulk multiplier, and the
# helmet scales uniformly by its own mild table rather than stretching with
# height.
#
# The stick hangs at rest — no flex pulse. The workbench's spinning stick could
# bow because nothing held it; here both fists are pinned to the shaft, and a
# bow that leaves the hands behind reads as broken rather than as flex. The
# FLEX row carries the fitted stiffness number instead.

# The camera framings the locker dollies between, plus the wide shot nothing is
# focused. The stick takes THREE of them because one shot cannot serve its eight
# rows: it is nearly as long as the player is tall, so a framing that contains
# all of it is barely a zoom at all. LENGTH and FLEX want the whole stick, CURVE
# and the blade tape want the blade, the knob and the wrap want the butt end.

# Behind-net puck play — the conservative rim stop (extracted from
# GoalieController, #519). Doctrine — "stop it, play it, get back", and why the
# GO race is this conservative — is in Scripts/controllers/CLAUDE.md. This object
# implements the trip; the stop hands the puck to GoaliePuckHandling.
#
# ── Boundary ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# This object owns the trip's DECISION, GEOMETRY and PHASE. It deliberately does
# NOT own:
#   - state-machine transitions (the controller drives GoalieStateMachine),
#   - body movement (the controller integrates position along `current_target`),
#   - puck mutations (the trap is REQUESTED via `wants_trap`, and the controller
#     performs it) — physics writes stay on the main thread by construction,
#     which is the split GoaliePerception / GoalieDecision generalises later.
# Pure value math otherwise: no scene lookups, no signals, no allocation per tick
# (the opponent scan is a caller-owned PackedVector3Array).

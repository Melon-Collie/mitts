# Owns the goalie's current AI state. RECOVERING is the stand-up window after
# butterfly (vulnerable beat where the goalie can't drop/RVH/react); SLIDING is
# the committed butterfly slide (push off, translate to seal). COILING sits
# between BUTTERFLY and SLIDING: the goalie has committed to a slide and is
# rotating around the planted (pivot) foot before the push-off translates it.
# READY is the half-down active stance when the puck is in the goalie's
# defensive half — distinct from STANDING so animation can show engagement.
# VH_LEFT / VH_RIGHT are the post-integrated stance for a sharp-angle SHOT
# threat still in FRONT of the goal line (post pad vertical for short-side-high
# coverage); RVH_* stays the at/below-goal-line seal (wraps, walkouts).
#
# The numeric values ride the wire as `state_enum` (u8), so new states are only
# ever APPENDED — reordering silently re-labels every goalie on every client.
# COVERING is the smother: the goalie collapses over a loose puck in the
# crease when every sweep lane is covered — the real cover/freeze, resolved by
# ruleset (NHL: whistle + defensive-zone faceoff; ARCADE: short hold, then a
# live release).
# PLAYING_PUCK is the tier-1 behind-net rim stop: skate out around the post,
# paddle-down stop at the boards behind the net, skate back — "stop it, leave
# it, get back", gated by an ultra-conservative go/no-go race.
# CATCHING / CATCHING_DOWN are the glove catch-and-hold: the puck is pinned in
# the glove (squeeze-and-look), split into upright and butterfly variants so
# clients' state-keyed body/head heights render the right silhouette. Same
# ruleset-split resolution as COVERING when held under pressure; an
# unpressured catch quick-drops and plays on (the real delay-of-game
# incentive).
# HALF_BUTTERFLY_* is one pad down (the goalie-local side named) and the other
# leg still loaded on its skate: the reach of a flat pad on one side, with a leg
# left to push and rise on.

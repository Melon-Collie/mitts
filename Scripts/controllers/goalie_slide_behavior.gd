# Butterfly drop animation + committed pivot-slide state. Real goalies plant
# the outside (non-post) leg, pivot off it, and ride the sealing leg through
# to the post — the body rotates around the push-off foot rather than
# translating laterally. Destination is committed at slide-start; mid-slide
# cannot correct. That's the realism win: fast cross-passes beat the slide
# because the goalie already committed the read.
#
# The controller owns state-machine transitions. This collaborator owns the
# numeric state of "are we sliding, and how far along the arc are we?" plus
# the butterfly drop animation timers shared with the idle butterfly pose.

# Owns the per-tick blade and arm IK pipeline:
# - Mouse → top-hand IK + blade placement (asymmetric ROM intersected with the
#   open ice via _board_reach_limit, then wall/goalie/net clamps).
# - Bottom-hand IK from the placed top hand + blade.
# - Geometry helpers shared with SkaterShotPoseCoordinator: blade_y_local,
#   blade_y_lean_corrected, stick_horiz.
# - Net exclusion zone and goalie body / butterfly box clamps. Both clamps
#   strip the puck on contact via _controller._do_release.
#
# Stateless rule layers (TopHandIK, BottomHandIK) live in domain/rules/. This
# class is the controller-facing dispatcher that builds configs from the
# controller's @export tunables and writes blade/hand positions onto Skater.

# The goalie's per-tick view of the other skaters — one scan, shared by every read
# that needs one. First half of the perception/decision split (#519, plan doc §6.2).
#
# ── Why this exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Six reads need a skater scan every tick — nearest opponent to the puck, nearest
# teammate to the puck, opposing positions for the sweep-lane model, "is any
# shooter near the puck", the backdoor depth cap, and the screen occlusion set.
# Run independently that is 12 walks of the registry per frame at 120 Hz x 2
# goalies to answer questions one walk answers, so the world is read ONCE into
# plain data here and every decision runs against the data rather than against
# live nodes.
#
# Frame-stamped and rebuilt lazily, so it is correct both from the physics tick and
# from the puck_released SIGNAL handler (which fires outside _physics_process and
# would otherwise read a stale or unbuilt view).
#
# Pure data out. The arrays are reused across rebuilds (PackedVector3Array.clear()
# keeps capacity), so a steady-state tick allocates nothing.

# Non-ghost OPPOSING skater positions — the sweep-lane model and the behind-net
# trip's pressure scan.
var opponents: PackedVector3Array = PackedVector3Array()
# Non-ghost skaters on the GOALIE'S OWN team — his defensive coverage. The
# backdoor depth cap asks, per weak-side threat, whether one of these is on him;
# a covered one-timer man is not the same play as a free one.
var teammates: PackedVector3Array = PackedVector3Array()
# Index-matched velocities of the two lists above — the goalie's own outlet read
# prices a forechecker by where he is going, not just where he is.
var opponent_vels: PackedVector3Array = PackedVector3Array()
var teammate_vels: PackedVector3Array = PackedVector3Array()
# Non-ghost opposing positions EXCLUDING the puck carrier — the backdoor depth cap
# asks about the weak-side one-timer threat, which by definition is not the passer.
var off_puck_opponents: PackedVector3Array = PackedVector3Array()
# Every non-ghost skater who is not in the shot-block stance, both teams — a
# defenceman screens his own goalie just as effectively as an opponent does.
#
# The blocker exclusion is deliberate. A body dropping into the lane is a
# DECLARED, coordinated commitment: the goalie can see it happen, knows which lane
# it is taking, and plays around it — that is the whole point of blocking in front
# of your own keeper. The same body is already priced against the shot as a block
# cylinder (Skater.get_body_block_radius), so counting it a second time as a blind
# made a teammate who helps into a teammate who hurts, and the pairing that
# followed — block cylinder plus a saturated screen delay — was the single most
# reliable way to score through traffic.

# Distance from the puck to the nearest non-ghost OPPOSING skater, INF if none.

# legally touch the puck, so he is not pressure, not a shooter, and not a reason
# to seal anything.

# same release event as a real shot — so without this gate a hard pass or clear
# up the ice reads as a low shot from across the rink and drops the goalie long

# ── Pre-armed read (quiet-eye anticipation) ──────────────────────────────────
# Reading a visible windup from a slot shooter (_is_reading_shot_threat) for
# `prearm_read_time` pre-programs the save, so on release both limbs start from
# `prearmed_reaction_delay` instead of the cold-read baseline. Grounded in
# quiet-eye research (Panchuk & Vickers: the save is prepared during a ~1 s
# fixation and executed ballistically in <200 ms) and Clear Sight Analytics'
# ~0.5 s set-and-sighted threshold. Screen and caught-moving penalties still ADD
# on top. The prime lingers `prearm_linger` past the read so the release event
# can't race the flag off on the tick the windup state clears.
#
# `prime_slot_distance` arms the same prime by PROXIMITY, with no windup to
# fixate on. It only makes both limbs START moving — the cold 0.18 s arm read
# exceeds a slot shot's ~0.10-0.16 s flight, so uncredited the goalie never moves
# at all — while `glove_react_max_speed` still bounds how much net he covers in
# the time left. The distance is grounded at the zone where a cold arm read
# outlasts the flight (flight < 0.18 s ⇒ under ~5-6 m for 25-30 m/s releases).
# ── Read staleness (the goalie can be WRONG) ─────────────────────────────────
# Every other latency here answers "when does he start moving"; this one answers
# "does he know where the puck is going". His committed belief about the shot's
# destination is the aim he read `read_lag` seconds ago — the shooter's published
# `predicted_shot_velocity`, sampled stale — and it converges onto the true line
# over `read_converge_time` once the puck is in flight and he can see it.
#
# Deterministic, not RNG: the error is a pure function of what the SHOOTER did
# with their aim, so a stable aim through the wind-up makes the stale sample equal
# the truth and a telegraphed shot is read exactly as well. Zero disables it
# entirely (belief == truth). Difficulty-varied via GoalieSkillProfile.read_lag_s.

# ice freezes the goalie from across the rink. Must be >= drop_max_time_to_impact
# (you read before you drop). Long shots outside the window aren't lost — the
# universal-reaction path picks them up at `universal_react_max_time_to_impact`.

# ── Screening ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A body between shooter and goalie hides the puck, so the read can't start until
# it emerges. GoalieBehaviorRules.screen_occlusion_delay solves how long the worst
# screener actually hides it given the shot's speed and geometry;
# `screen_max_extra_delay` is only the CAP on that, so a perfect screen still
# leaves a last-instant chance. Both the leg drop and the arm reach are held by
# it. Evaluated once at the read — the beat is lost the moment the puck is
# hidden, and re-checking mid-flight would hand the time back.
#
# The silhouette values are MEASUREMENTS, not feel dials — they size the shadow,
# and the shadow is geometry. They mirror Scenes/Skater.tscn (origin at the hips,
# feet ~0.85 below it). Sight is taken at the height the eyeline crosses the body,
# so the same screener is a torso to a standing goalie and a pair of shins to a
# goalie who has gone down looking for the puck.

# How far off his angle he will step to get his eyes around a body. Feel, not
# geometry: the STEP is solved (GoalieBehaviorRules.screen_peek_offset), this is
# only how much net he is willing to sell for the look. A screen he cannot clear
# inside it buys him nothing and he stays square, which is the intended failure.
var screen_peek_max_offset: float = 0.35     # m
# HIS EYES ARE NOT ON HIS MIDLINE, and that is the first thing he moves. Craning
# — head over, shoulders leaning, feet and pads planted — buys this much lateral
# sight for NO angle at all, because the coverage does not move with it. Only
# what the neck cannot reach is paid for out of `screen_peek_max_offset` with an
# actual step, which is why a goalie should be seen shuffling for a big screen
# and not moving at all for a small one.
#
# The head yaw that already tracks the puck (head_track_max_yaw_deg) is a
# different quantity — where he is LOOKING, not where his eyes ARE — and it is
# still cosmetic. This one is not: it moves the sightline the occlusion solve is

# ── Caught moving ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Being unset costs three things, and only the third is perceptual: momentum he

# entered with lateral speed splays like a slide's — _update_butterfly_five_hole),
# and a small beat of extra read latency here. `move_read_speed_delay` is the
# residual an off-balance body pays firing a response it has already chosen; see
# GoalieBehaviorRules.movement_read_penalty for why the whole cost of being unset
# must not sit on latency.
#
# `move_read_scramble_delay` is priced separately and stays large: standing up out
# of a butterfly or riding a committed lunge carries no lateral momentum for the
# drift to model, and the failure there is that the response is not AVAILABLE yet

#
# ONE VALUE, deliberately flat. Measured, the weight moves him only a few
# CENTIMETRES: for a carrier with the puck 0.6 m to the side, the whole span from
# w=0 to w=0.30 is ~10 cm at 3 m, ~5 cm at 6 m and ~3 cm at 9 m, because the
# lateral target is a damped, geometrically compressed arc position rather than a

# scale with 1/distance, leaving the ratio unchanged with range.
var shooter_weight: float = 0.20
# PINNED-WINDUP override — applies to BOTH shot wind-ups
# (SkaterStateMachine.state_pins_puck). A pinned puck does not jitter (the slapper

# pulls him off the honest shot origin. Zero, not a smaller weight.
#
# MAGNITUDE: worth ~3.5 cm of squaring at 3 m on a 1 m pin — the arc solve
# compresses lateral target changes, so do not reach for this lever expecting it

# Slapper aim shade (anticipatory read): shades the lateral target toward where

#
# DELIBERATELY SLAPPER-ONLY (`_reading_planted_windup`), unlike the squaring

# the body physically moves toward a predicted crossing — so it is only safe
# against a shooter who cannot relocate the shot origin. The slapper plants
# (locomotion suppressed + an active velocity drag); a wrister shooter keeps full
# thrust and can skate out from under the shade and finish against the grain,
# making a mis-aimed shade worse than none. The TEMPORAL read credit (the

# to a frame and a pop lands up to a frame after its due instant. Ordinary
# hitches add ~15-25 ms on top.
#
# A trigger inside that band fires 4-12/s on a perfectly healthy deep queue, and
# every fire discards real inputs the client already predicted with — one visible
# reconcile each. A target below the ~12 ms quantization floor is just as wrong:
# the very next frame reads as overdue again and re-arms the trigger.
#
# The trade is asymmetric and that decides the sizing: tolerating slip costs
# input LATENCY (invisible, bounded, and corrected when it grows); draining

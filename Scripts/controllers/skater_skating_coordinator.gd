# Procedural skating stride — no skeleton, no animation clips. Advances a stride
# phase by ground speed and swings each leg about its hip via Skater.set_leg_swing(),
# matching the same per-frame "write the transforms" idiom the arm-bone IK already
# uses. Beyond the leg swing it owns the skating STANCE: a speed-engaged crouch
# (hip + knee flex with a matching whole-body drop via Skater.set_skating_crouch_drop
# so the skates stay planted), a per-stride body bob, and the trunk texture the
# pose coordinator layers into the torso lean (trunk_pitch_add / trunk_roll_add
# — effort dig and weight-shift sway). Purely cosmetic and derived entirely from
# the skater's velocity, so it
# costs zero network state: remote skaters animate identically from the velocity
# that interpolation already hands them.
#
# The phase is advanced only on real render ticks — SkaterController guards the
# call with `not is_replaying` so reconcile re-simulation (many ticks per frame)
# doesn't over-spin the gait. Standstill freezes the phase (advance is scaled by
# speed) and the intensity envelope eases the legs back to their rest pose, so
# nothing pops when starting or stopping.

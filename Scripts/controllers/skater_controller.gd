# ── Sprint / Stamina Tuning ───────────────────────────────────────────────────

# sprint_max_speed_multiplier is OVERWRITTEN per-build by apply_attributes
# (PlayerAttributes.sprint_ceiling_mult), which grounds the sprint CEILING to the

# committed straight-line speed at the cost of agility, mirroring the

# ── Hit-Button (Body-Check Commit) Tuning ─────────────────────────────────────
# The hit button (Ctrl / input.hit_held) commits a check: it delivers the full
# body-check transfer (see Skater.hit_passive_transfer_mult for the uncommitted
# floor), and pays for it with a stamina drain on the shared sprint pool PLUS the
# commitment of pulling the stick off the ice — while committed you can't poke,
# receive a pass, or corral a loose puck (gated in PuckController/PickupClaim on
# the replicated skater.hit_committed). So a big hit is a committed read (line them
# up, spend stamina, give up puck play), not a free bump. Deterministic from the
# replicated input.hit_held, so every cost re-derives through reconcile replay.
var hit_stamina_drain_per_sec: float = 0.5    # drained while committing a check
# Turn-rate scale while committing (< 1.0 = wider turns). 1.0 — the commitment
# cost sits entirely on the withdrawn stick above, so you can steer freely to line
# up the hit; penalising the ATTEMPT (tracking a mover) rather than the miss is
# backwards. Full-speed homing is still bounded because sprinting in for max
# closing pays sprint's own turn radius (sprint_turn_multiplier). Dial below 1.0
# if committed checks feel too sticky.
var hit_turn_multiplier: float = 1.0
# Commit stance (cosmetic): while the Hit button is held the skater visibly loads
# up for the check — leans into it, sinks into a crouch, drives the leading
# shoulder forward across the chest with the near arm tucked, and (empty-handed
# only) pulls the stick up off the ice. Three parts on two clocks: the lean and
# crouch are a render-rate trunk blend (GaitCheckLayer), the per-side
# shoulder load-up is physics-rate on the skater (CheckStanceRules), and the
# stick rides the IK's blade_y. All three derive from the replicated
# skater.hit_committed, so they read on every machine, and all three are
# gameplay-inert while committed. Deliberately pronounced — the commitment (and
# the withdrawn stick) has to be legible to the player and their opponent.
#
# The lean is deliberately the smallest of the three: past roughly 20° a skater
# reads as reaching for something rather than coiling behind a shoulder, so the
# pitch sets the attitude and the shoulder carries the read.

# Loaded stick pose: while committing (empty-handed), the stick STOPS chasing the
# cursor and eases to a body-local "ready to hit" pose, so the stance reads as a
# distinct silhouette instead of a raised-but-still-tracking stick. A BEARING off
# the posed hand, not a blade position — the blade sits one (choked) stick along
# it, so how far out it lands is the choke's business and this is purely which
# way the stick points. Dimensionless XZ: +x is the forehand side (×
# blade_side_sign), −z is in front of the skater. The sweep is signed by the lead
# (Skater.get_check_lead), which keeps the stick out of the shoulder driving into
# the contact and moves the silhouette WITH the shoulders. Gameplay-inert — the
# blade is withdrawn from puck play while committed, so this is a pure cosmetic
# override that eases back to cursor tracking on release. Feel dials; verify the
# silhouette in-game.

# to the blade-first solve, which parks it at the shoulder and folds the elbow
# backwards — see SkaterIKCoordinator._commit_hand_pose. In FRONT of the
# shoulder (−z) is the load-bearing part: the arm roots at the leaning,

# ── Body-Check Stagger Tuning ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Getting checked hard staggers the victim: a temporary thrust penalty plus a
# stamina bite, both scaled by how hard the hit landed (the m/s transfer impulse).
# stagger_timer (seconds) holds the recovery window AND drives the penalty depth —
# a harder hit sets a longer timer, easing back to full thrust as it decays. Flat
# for every player in v1 (the hit strength already reflects the attacker's Size/
# Physical/Speed and the victim's mass). Pure math in BodyCheckRules; deterministic
# and replicated so it survives reconcile replay (same treatment as stamina).
#
# Grounded to the inelastic magnitudes: the delivered victim impulse is
# closing_speed × transfer × m_a/(m_a+m_b), so at a MEDIUM build (transfer 0.65,
# equal mass → ×0.5) it is ~0.325 × closing. The ref point is deliberately the SAME
# as the puck-strip threshold (Puck.body_check_strip_threshold, 1.35): a hit hard
# enough to count as a full check is exactly a hit hard enough to knock the puck
# loose. That lands a full check + strip at ~4 m/s closing for a medium build
# (~3.4 for a heavy one) — "square them up and skate into them with some pace".
# Closing past the ref keeps scaling the impulse linearly into the knockdown band
# below, so a sprint / head-on collision is a bigger hit: a ceiling, not a
# requirement. Still feel tunables.
var stagger_min_impulse: float = 0.6       # m/s transfer delta below which a hit doesn't stagger

var stagger_max_thrust_penalty: float = 0.5  # peak thrust reduction at full stagger
# Cosmetic stumble while staggered: a decaying trunk wobble layered into the
# gait's trunk texture (GaitStaggerLayer). Amplitude tracks the time
# left on stagger_timer, and the wobble phase is derived FROM the timer, so
# every machine renders the identical stumble from the replicated value.
var stagger_wobble_deg: float = 9.0   # peak trunk wobble at full stagger
var stagger_wobble_hz: float = 3.0    # wobble frequency
# Directional recoil: on top of the wobble, the whole torso reels the way the
# hit shoved it (pitch + roll), easing out as stagger_timer decays — a body
# absorbing the check, not just shaking. Direction is the transfer impulse
# (stagger_recoil_dir); remotes recoil generically backward for plain staggers
# (they get the timer off the wire, not the direction), but a knockdown entry
# re-derives the true direction from the replicated slide velocity
# (_sync_knockdown_meta). Applied in SkaterPoseCoordinator._apply_lean.
var stagger_recoil_deg: float = 13.0  # peak torso recoil lean at full stagger
# ── Knockdown Tuning ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The top of the stagger continuum: a hit whose victim impulse exceeds
# knockdown_impulse KNOCKS THE VICTIM DOWN — movement locked, no puck interaction,
# the body slides from the hit and bleeds speed via knockdown_friction — for a
# recovery window scaling with the hit (see BodyCheckRules.knockdown_seconds_from_
# impulse). knockdown_timer rides the SAME replicated / snapped / decayed rail as
# stagger_timer. Deliberately kept ABOVE the full-check point (stagger_ref 1.35):
# a full check staggers + strips; a KNOCKDOWN is the reward for a genuinely SOLID
# hit — ~5.5 m/s closing at a medium build (~4.5 for a heavy one), the pace of a
# committed skate-in on a carrier, up to a maximal ~9.5 m/s head-on / sprint
# collision. It sits just above the AI's commit bar (AIBodyCheck.COMMIT_IMPULSE_M_S
# 1.6) so a committed bot check lands a hard stagger/strip and, at real closing,
# tips into a knockdown. Set knockdown_impulse very high (or 0) to effectively
# disable knockdowns.

# collapse crouch that matches the gait's drop, the whole cosmetic rig tips
# about the skates in the hit direction under a tipping-body model
# (KnockdownFallRules, applied to MeshRoot via Skater.set_knockdown_fall),
# bounces off the ice, and lies ON it: the torso fold resolves from a reflexive
# airborne curl to the ground-plane complement (fold_at) and the limbs scatter
# from first impact by the hit's momentum and side (sprawl_into), so the lying
# pose is solved per hit rather than one authored keyframe. All driven off the
# replicated knockdown_timer (elapsed down-time = _knockdown_total − timer), so
# it renders identically on every machine and through reconcile, like the
# stagger stumble.

# ── Facing Tuning ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# How fast facing drifts toward the cursor during normal play. Lower = more
# skating lag before the body re-orients (more backskate/crossover time).
# Good range: 1.0 (very lazy) – 3.0 (snappy).

var facing_drag_speed_braking: float = 10.0
# Facing RECOVERY rate during the shot follow-through. The coil freezes facing at
# the wind-up cursor position (it must — the coil is the torso twisting relative
# to the planted lower body), so at release the body is squared to where the aim
# STARTED, not the cursor. Left at the normal drag, facing can't re-square in the
# ~0.22 s follow-through, so when blade-tracking resumes the target is ROM-clamped
# to the stale facing and the stick swings to the wrong side before catching the
# cursor. Recover hard through the follow-through so the body is re-squared by the
# handoff and the blade tracks straight from the finish to the cursor.
var follow_through_facing_recover_speed: float = 18.0

# ── Blade / Stick / Top-Hand IK Tuning ────────────────────────────────────────
# Blade world-space Y. 0.0 = ice surface. Converted to upper-body-local via
# SkaterIKCoordinator.blade_y_local() before any IK or pose call, so the blade always sits at a
# fixed world height regardless of where the upper body anchor is placed in the
# scene. This also means crouching (block stance) doesn't pull the blade
# through the ice — the local Y compensates automatically.
var blade_height: float = 0.03
# World-space height the blade rises to when lifted (stick-lift / Q held, or a
# forced pop from an opponent's stick lift). A lifted blade clears grounded
# pucks and sticks — it only meets airborne pucks, to tip them. Eased in via
# Skater._blade_lift_blend and consumed by SkaterIKCoordinator.blade_y_local().
#
# LOAD-BEARING, and pinned between two hard walls — it is the pivot that decides
# up-tip vs. knock-down (PuckCollisionRules.deflect_loft_speed), and it sets how
# high a lifted blade can reach. Contact point = blade_height + this.
#   FLOOR (~0.30): must clear a LOW saucer's apex (~0.26 m, fixed — loft is a
#     fixed launch speed). Drop below it and camping HIGH starts ROOFING saucer
#     passes instead of swatting them.
#   CEILING (0.5675): contact point − PuckController.PICKUP_RADIUS must stay at
#     or below the airborne threshold (GameRules.PUCK_AIRBORNE_HEIGHT_M + a
#     resting puck's centre = 0.0675). Above that, pucks between the threshold
#     and the lifted blade's downward reach are touchable by NEITHER plane — a
#     dead zone where saucers become untouchable.
# 0.52 (contact point 0.55) sits at the top of that range, which is where the
# tips that matter live: a HIGH feed arriving at a net-front player sits at
# 0.9–1.1 m, and the reach ceiling only gets there at the top of the band.
var blade_lift_height: float = 0.52
# Lifted-blade pivot for the MID deflect mode (air-up tip): the low-air plane,
# under the HIGH pivot above and above a saucer's apex (~0.21–0.26 m) so
# camping MID still can't cheese saucer passes. See the deflect-mode table in
# PuckCollisionRules.deflect_loft_speed.
var blade_lift_height_mid: float = 0.35
# Fixed, rigid shaft length (hand to blade heel). Baseline 1.30 m ≈ adult
# senior stick shaft (butt-to-heel). The blade mesh extends forward from the
# heel; see Skater.blade_length. Total hand-to-toe is stick_length + blade_length.
var stick_length: float = GameRules.DEFAULT_STICK_LENGTH_M
# Hand Y in upper-body-local space. Baseline resting position (used in the FAR
# regime); in the CLOSE regime the hand rises toward `hand_y_max` so the stick
# tilts more vertical and the blade can tuck in close to the body.
#
# This export is the MESH-NATIVE (Size L2, 5'10") value; apply_attributes scales it
# by height_mult, matching the appearance pass scaling the whole skeleton about the
# ice plane — so the hand sits at the same body point (0.50 m × height below the
# shoulder) on every build instead of pinning to one absolute height.
#
# The upper body rides at height_mult × 1.0 m world Y (FACEOFF_SPAWN_HEIGHT is the
# physics origin for every build — only the mesh skeleton scales; the cosmetic
# skating crouch lowers it up to ~7 cm at speed) and the blade at blade_height
# (~ice), so -0.10 gives a hand world Y of 0.90 m × height (hip height on each
# frame) and a rest stick angle of ~42° at L2, approaching a real lie-5 address
# (~45°). The steeper stick pulls the rest carry circle in ~6 cm (stick_horiz
# 1.03 → 0.97), but the shallower shoulder-to-hand drop re-aims the arm budget
# sideways (derived backhand ROM 0.37 → 0.46 m of hand displacement), so rim reach
# is roughly preserved and the directional reach lean stays pure bonus on top.
var hand_rest_y: float = -0.10
# Ceiling for hand Y in the CLOSE regime. When aiming very close to the
# skater, the hand rises to shorten the stick's horizontal projection; this
# cap keeps the pose anatomical (0.30 local = 1.30 m world at L2 — the hand
# won't climb past chest level). Mesh-native like hand_rest_y; apply_
# attributes scales it by height_mult so the ceiling stays chest-height on
# every frame. With default stick_length = 1.30 m and the blade on the ice
# (blade_y ≈ -0.97 local at L2), hand_y_max = 0.30 → hand-to-blade drop
# 1.27 → min horizontal stick reach ≈ 0.28 m.
var hand_y_max: float = 0.30
# Asymmetric ROM for the top hand (measured from shoulder in upper-body-local
# horizontal plane, expressed in "forehand side = positive angle" convention).

# allows full arm extension, supporting one-handed backhand plays.

# Board shield (see BoardPlayRules): how close the boards must be before a
# CARRIER's stance starts turning parallel to them, and how far it may turn. The

# Cap on how fast the aim target can move in world XZ per second. The IK consumes

# 10 m/s crosses it in ~118 ms. Under attributes v4 the blade tracks every build's
# cursor at the same fidelity (hands_blade_mult() is 1.0 by constitution — no hands
# stat), so this cap is uniform. Tune UP if deliberate aim feels laggy, DOWN if
# fast dangling feels the same at L1 and L5 — a live-feel call that cannot be
# measured headless.

# 1/lever^k — a long stick sweeps faster (tip speed below) but can't cut back
# as fast; a short stick is the scalpel. This is the hands seesaw of
# attributes v4 — geometry, never a fidelity table. The shipped 250 was

# ── Nudge (self-tap, nutmeg setup) ────────────────────────────────────────────
# Tap stick-lift (Q) while carrying in plain SKATING_WITH_PUCK to push the puck a
# tiny amount off the blade — a self-pass for threading the puck between a
# defender's legs (the body block only covers the torso now, so a grounded puck
# slips under). The released puck inherits the skater's horizontal velocity plus
# a small nudge along the blade's current motion direction, so RELATIVE to the
# carrier it's just a soft tap in the stick's sweep direction — keep skating and
# you re-collect it. nudge_speed is that relative tap speed (m/s).
var nudge_speed: float = 2.2

# Fraction of the carrier's horizontal momentum the nudged puck inherits. Below

# ── Bottom-Hand IK Tuning ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# rotation limit — ensuring the hand stays connected during any normal swing.
# Never influences blade placement. See domain/rules/bottom_hand_ik.gd.

# 1. RESOLVE the pin, not merely test it. Puck._physics_process places the puck at
#    get_carry_target_global() every tick, so a correction that is computed and

# 2. Remember the RESOLVED pin as the next sweep's start. The twine is two-sided
#    and NetGeometry.interior_or_mouth classifies from the segment start, so a
#    `prev` that was allowed inside the cavity flips the next tick's faces from
#    "push out" to "hold in", and one tick of penetration latches: a stick swiped
#    laterally behind the goal line walks the puck through the side mesh and across
#    the line. `prev` is therefore always a position the net has already vouched
#    for.
#
# There is no legality test here and none anywhere else. A puck ends up in the

# Loose-puck geometry in the blue paint — the reads behind the sweep, the cover
# and the catch. GoalieController owns their lifecycles and calls in here to ask
# where the puck is and whether it can be played.
#
# The real hierarchy (USA Hockey "Controlling Rebounds"): COVER under pressure,
# SWEEP when there is time to play it, leave it only with clear teammate
# possession. The sweep is only the correct clear when a corner exit lane is OPEN,
# so the cover triggers exactly when the lane model says every sweep would feed an
# opponent's stick AND an opponent is on the puck. The catch is the same family
# from the other end: a controlled glove save PINS the puck, and resolves by
# pressure — held under pressure it freezes the play, unpressured it is held only a
# beat (the real delay-of-game incentive). Either hold, where nothing whistles it,
# ends the way the cover's does: set down on the blade and swept out.
#
# ── Boundary ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# GEOMETRY AND PREDICATES ONLY. This answers questions and owns the timer FIELDS
# those answers read; the controller advances every timer and makes every
# transition. Do NOT add a lifecycle API here (begin_cover / tick_cover_reach /
# end_cover and friends): the controller writes these fields itself, so any such
# method is unreachable the moment it is written. See
# Scripts/controllers/CLAUDE.md → "What kills a collaborator extraction".

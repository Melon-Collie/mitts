# Committed wrister power fraction (0..1): the controller converts it to the

# shooter drives the SAME pure-mouse power model deterministically. Set by bots at
# their shot/pass windup, and by the gamepad path from the right-stick push
# magnitude. Mouse humans leave it at the default (unused — they read real cursor
# speed). Serialized as a u8 for the gamepad path: a pad CLIENT's power has to
# reach the host, or the host re-derives it from a parked (≈0 speed) cursor and

# the pad has no meaningful cursor speed, so the right-stick push magnitude is the
# whole power signal (aim still flows through the positional origin→cursor model,
# since the gamepad parks the cursor in the stick direction). Rides as flag bit

# Snap a power fraction to the u8 wire grid. Senders MUST run their value through

# (LocalController._process_input) and serializes separately, so an unquantized
# value would have the client predict full precision while the host decodes 1/255
# steps — a divergence on the one tick that sets the whole shot's launch velocity.
# Power is committed once per shot (not per tick, like position), so quantizing at
# the source is cheap here and buys an exact match rather than a tolerance.

# Gathers the local player's per-tick InputState from mouse + keyboard, OR — when
# the gamepad is the active device (InputDeviceTracker) and a pad is connected —
# from a gamepad.
#
# The gamepad path is deliberately thin: the right stick drives a SYNTHESIZED
# screen cursor (GamepadAimRules, an absolute "skill stick" anchored on the
# skater's on-screen position) that is stored into the SAME
# InputState.mouse_screen_pos / mouse_world_pos the mouse feeds. Everything below
# the gatherer — blade IK, the wrister charge tracker, its travel gate, smart-ping
# targeting — reads those two fields, so it runs byte-identically for pad and
# mouse with no controller branch in the sim. The pad's buttons/triggers are read
# directly here (contained behind the pref) and mapped onto the existing input
# flags. See docs/gameplay-design.md for the mapping rationale.

# Reach disc: how far the cursor can sit from the anchor on screen. The blade IK
# ROM-clamps beyond this, so it just bounds the cursor to reachable ice. Also the
# radius the cursor is placed at while aiming a shot — there it only sets how far
# out the aim point sits; the DIRECTION is exact at any radius because the shot
# cursor anchors on the puck (see _shot_anchor_screen). Feel tunable.

# Loft mode (0 flat / 1 low saucer / 2 high), from the skater's input frame.

var elevation_level: int = 0
# True when the blade is lifted off the ice (own Q held, or involuntarily
# popped up by an opponent's stick lift). Effective value: the receiver only
# needs the resolved "is the blade up" answer for rendering and the
# on-ice/off-ice interaction gate.
var blade_up: bool = false
# Sprint stamina (0..1 fraction of the full pool) and the exhaustion lockout
# flag. Both replicated so the local player's reconcile can snap them to the
# host's authoritative value before replaying inputs — same treatment as
# velocity. See StaminaRules / LocalController.reconcile.
var stamina: float = 1.0
var sprint_locked: bool = false
# Body-check stagger: seconds of thrust-penalty recovery remaining on the victim.
# Replicated for the same reason as stamina — the local player's reconcile snaps
# it to the host baseline before replay and it decays deterministically forward
# (see BodyCheckRules / SkaterController._apply_movement). Host-authoritative: only
# the host sets it on a hit; clients receive the resolved value off the wire.
var stagger_timer: float = 0.0
# Body-check knockdown: seconds of full movement lockout remaining. Replicated for
# the same reason as stagger_timer — the local victim's reconcile snaps it to the
# host baseline and it decays deterministically forward. Host-authoritative.
var knockdown_timer: float = 0.0
# Movement INTENT: the raw WASD vector (world frame, 8-way quantized on the
# wire) and the brake hold. The gait reads what the player is TRYING to do —
# crossover intent, deliberate hockey stop, no-keys glide — a beat before
# velocity responds. They are also LOAD-BEARING, not merely cosmetic: they drive
# SkaterMovementRules.integrate_forward on both the client render
# (RemoteController) and the host claim rewind
# (LagCompRewind.forward_predict_skater), so render == rewind depends on them
# surviving the rewind snapshot (StateBufferManager copies them). One byte on
# the wire (v15).
var move_intent: Vector2 = Vector2.ZERO
var brake_intent: bool = false
# Resolved sprint-boost state (held + moving + stamina available), from
# SkaterController.sprint_active on the simulating machine. Drives the sprint
# gait read (longer strides, deeper sit, forward lean) on client-rendered
# remotes, which never resolve sprint themselves, and the sprint term of the
# forward prediction (load-bearing, like move_intent above). Bit 5 of the intent
# byte (v16).
var sprint_active: bool = false
# Resolved hit-commit (the Hit button held + stamina available), from
# SkaterController.hit_committed on the simulating machine. Replicated so the
# body-check resolver reads a REMOTE victim's brace and a remote attacker's
# full-vs-passive delivery correctly on a client (the host knows all locally).
# Bit 6 of the intent byte (no block growth).
var hit_committed: bool = false
# Which side of the still puck the frozen blade addresses during a wrister aim
# (face-normal sign, ±1) — the re-address tell, so render-only clients show the
# shooter's blade on the side the shot will push from. Meaningful ONLY while
# shot_state == WRISTER_AIM (validity is implicit in the state, so the wire
# spends one bit); garbage otherwise, and consumers must gate on the state.
var wrister_address_side: int = 1
# The balance lean (world XZ, radians) and its spring rate. LOAD-BEARING: the
# lean translates the UpperBody frame the wire's blade_position and
# top_hand_position are local to, so a receiver that placed the frame from any
# other lean would put the blade somewhere else. The local reconcile snaps both
# to the host's before replay (v60).

# World-space top-hand (grip) point. host-only, not serialized — paired with
# blade_contact_world to form the shaft segment for stick-lift claim
# resolution. The wire `top_hand_position` is upper-body-local, so it can't be

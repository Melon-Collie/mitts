class_name GoalieNetworkState

# Goalie wire state — populated on the host each tick from the live Goalie
# node body-part transforms and broadcast as part of the world snapshot.
#
# Two layers of fields:
#   - Root: position_x/z + rotation_y carry the Goalie node's world placement;
#     velocity_x/z feed the client's dead-reckon past the newest sample, and
#     state_enum + five_hole_openness are read back through the accessors below
#     (the bot shot model's stance read). Clients run no goalie AI of their own.
#   - Pose: socket transforms for each body part, in goalie-local space.
#     Rotations are radians. Body root has pitch + roll for shoulder-save lean
#     (yaw is the existing rotation_y field).
#
# The stick is rigid-attached to the blocker arm IRL (blocker pad sits on the
# back of the stick hand). Its transform is derived from the blocker socket
# plus the fixed scene offset baked into BlockArm — no independent socket
# needed on the wire.

# slot like the other post stances) vs standing-family (standing / ready /
# recovering — RECOVERING counts as up because the rising legs re-open the
# standing five-hole slot). state_enum is written as `GoalieStateMachine.State
# as int` (see GoalieController.capture/apply) — this accessor is the one place
# that mapping is interpreted off the wire, so readers (bot AI shot model,
# remote pose) never hand-roll the enum split.

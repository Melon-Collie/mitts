class_name IceRingField
extends Node

# Feeds the ice shader's analytic on-ice HUD — player rings, elevation chevrons,
# and the slapper one-timer indicator (see Shaders/ice.gdshader). None of those marks is an object: a ring under a player
# is just ice coloured differently near a position, so the shader computes it and
# this node's whole job is to hand over the positions. Per frame that is a
# handful of set_shader_parameter calls, regardless of roster size.
#
# Drawing them as nodes instead would put a coplanar alpha quad per skater in the
# depth-sorted transparency pass, hovering millimetres above the ice it z-fights,
# faceting up close. As part of the opaque ice surface there is no transparency
# pass, nothing to z-fight, and the shader's fwidth feather antialiases
# analytically at any camera height.
#
# The slapper indicator is SELF-ONLY — at most one skater shows it — so it rides
# as scalar uniforms rather than arrays.
#
# Sibling of IceScratchMap: same place in the tree, same owner (HockeyRink), same
# job of turning live skater state into something the ice shader samples.

# Shader arrays are fixed-size, so this is the ceiling on simultaneous rings —
# sized past 5v5's ten so a roster change does not silently drop one. Kept in
# lockstep with the array length declared in ice.gdshader.

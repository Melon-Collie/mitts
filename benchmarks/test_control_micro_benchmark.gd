# ── Control-tick micro-benchmark (report-only; NOT in the default suite) ─────
# Times SkaterController._process_input and its parts on one real skater, so the
# per-tick control budget can be ranked instead of guessed at. Sister tool to
# test_ai_micro_benchmark.gd: that one says where a bot's DECISION budget goes;
# this one says where the CONTROL budget goes — the tick every skater runs,
# bot or human, on the host.
#
# Why this exists: _process_input is the single largest main-thread cost in a
# 5v5 frame, and it runs 120 Hz x roster on the host, so on a dedicated server
# it is essentially the entire bill. It is also already well optimised at the
# obvious level (IK configs cached, ROM projection closed-form, collaborators
# memoised), which means the remaining wins are the non-obvious kind and
# guessing at them wastes time. Everything here is a µs-per-call number on one
# frozen, realistic pose.
#
# Run explicitly:
#   bash .claude/hooks/run-gut.sh -gdir=res://benchmarks
#
# Compare RELATIVELY (part vs part, before vs after a change), never as an
# absolute frame cost: a debug build inflates GDScript, and the parts overlap
# (the state machine's total contains the blade IK it calls).

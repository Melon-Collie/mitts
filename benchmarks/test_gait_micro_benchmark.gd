extends GutTest

# ── Gait / render-pose micro-benchmark (report-only; NOT in the default suite) ─
# Times Skater.render_pose_update and its parts on one real skater.
#
# Why this exists, precisely: a cosmetic-freeze sweep split the rig in half and
# found the WRITE half (bone poses, stick/arm rebuild, both elbow IK solves)
# costs 0.12 ms +/- 0.32 across ten skaters — statistically nothing — while the
# SOLVE half costs 1.82 ms. That is ~80% of all freezable cosmetic cost in the
# frame, and it is this path. Everything else on the cosmetic list is rounding
# error beside it. Full results: docs/performance-findings.md.
#
# Run explicitly:
#   bash .claude/hooks/run-gut.sh -gdir=res://benchmarks
#
# Compare RELATIVELY (part vs part, state vs state, before vs after a change),
# never as an absolute frame cost: a debug build inflates GDScript, and the
# parts overlap.
#
# The gait is timed in several STATES, since it branches on intent, planting,
# braking and shot state, and on both of its paths: NativeSkaterGait where the
# extension is built, and the GDScript reference it falls back to.

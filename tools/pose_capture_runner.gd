# The body of tools/pose_capture.gd — see that file for what the tool is for,
# how to run it, and why the work lives in a separate script.
#
# ── Why it drives the real controller ───────────────────────────────────────
# Poses are produced by feeding scripted InputStates to a real SkaterController
# on a real Skater, not by writing marker transforms directly. Writing the
# markers would test the renderer against itself: the conversion's whole risk is
# that a pose ARRIVES differently (a write landing on a bone instead of a node,
# in a different parent frame or a different order), and only running the code
# that produces the write exercises that.
#
# ── Determinism ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A pixel diff is worthless if the same code renders differently twice, so
# nothing here may depend on wall-clock timing:
#   • The skater's own _process / _physics_process are switched OFF and called
#     by hand with a fixed DT, one of each per step. Real frame deltas would
#     advance the gait phase and the stick flex by a different amount each run.
#   • VFX and the world HUD are frozen (CosmeticFreeze). Both are non-rig content —
#     particle systems are stochastic and the HUD is camera-derived — so they
#     would contribute diff noise about nothing.
#   • Each pose gets a FRESH skater and controller. Charge timers, lean
#     smoothing and stamina all persist, so reusing one actor would make a
#     pose's appearance depend on which pose ran before it.
#   • No shadow maps. Shadow rasterisation is the one part of this scene that
#     wanders between runs, and the acne would read as scattered diff pixels.
#
# ── Reading a diff ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Sub-perceptual differences localised to an alpha-sort seam are acceptable;
# anything structural or scattered is not. The bounding box is what separates
# them — a change confined to a few pixels at one silhouette edge reads very
# differently from the same pixel COUNT scattered across the whole tile.

# diffing.
#
# BOTH vectors are relative to the SKATER's origin, which sits at hip height
# (GameRules.FACEOFF_SPAWN_HEIGHT), not at the ice. Aiming at a world-space point

# The live game's own framing, so a tile can answer the question the beauty
# shots cannot: does the pose read from where it is actually played? Which for
# a hockey game is high, tilted and some way off — a fold that is unmistakable
# from a metre away is a few dozen pixels of shoulder from up there.
#
# Geometry straight out of GameCamera Step 5a/5b: pitch is −tilt, and the rig
# is pushed BACK by height·tan(90° − tilt) so the tilt lands the subject in the
# middle of the frame rather than at its top. Tilt, height and FOV come from the
# prefs and the camera itself rather than being copied here, so a change to any
# of them turns up in these tiles instead of leaving them rendering a camera the
# game stopped having. Height is the on-puck FLOOR (GameCamera zooms out from
# there as the play spreads), which is the closest the game ever gets to a
# skater — anything unreadable here is unreadable in play.
#
# The FOV is the one number NOT taken as-is. A tile is 384 px and the game's
# frame is the project's full height, so rendering the game's own FOV here
# shrinks the player's whole screen into a thumbnail and tells you nothing about
# how big anything reads. Narrowing it by exactly that ratio instead makes the
# tile a pixel-for-pixel CROP of the middle of the player's frame: same camera,
# same perspective, same on-screen size — just less of the rink around him.

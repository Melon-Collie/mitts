# mitts_native — GDExtension hot-path kernels

C++ ports of per-tick math kernels, registered as `Native*` classes
(`NativeTopHandIK`, `NativeBottomHandIK`, `NativeSkaterMovement`,
`NativePuckStep`, `NativeBladeDangle`, `NativeArmRig`, `NativeSkaterGait`). The
GDScript originals (in `Scripts/domain/rules/`, `Scripts/controllers/` and
`Scripts/actors/`) remain the behavioral
reference; each ported kernel is pinned to its reference by a seeded fuzz test
(`tests/unit/rules/test_native_ik_parity.gd` and its siblings). **Change a
solver in both places or not at all** — the parity tests are the gate.

This directory exists because interpreter overhead on the 120 Hz tick (and its
reconcile-replay amplification) is the game's scripting bottleneck. The rule
for what belongs here: settled, evaluation-grade math with a coarse call
boundary — primitives and vectors in, results out, no callbacks into GDScript
mid-solve. Feel-tunable orchestration stays in GDScript.

## The one non-kernel: `NativeGifEncoder`

`NativeGifEncoder` (goal-clip GIF export, `Scripts/game/gif_exporter.gd`) is
registered here but is **not** a port and touches no tick. It qualifies on the
other half of the rule — a coarse boundary around work GDScript is simply too
slow for (palette quantization plus LZW over ~150 frames: seconds interpreted,
well under one in C++). Three consequences worth knowing:

- **It has no parity gate**, because it has no GDScript reference to agree
  with. `tests/unit/game/test_gif_encoder.gd` pins it by decoding its output
  with an independently written GIF reader instead.
- **It is deliberately absent from `NativeKernels.KERNEL_CLASSES`.** That
  census answers "is gameplay running the C++ or the GDScript path?", and a
  non-gameplay class in it would make the boot log and debug digest report
  `PARTIAL` for a reason that has nothing to do with the tick.
- **It is the reason `build_profile.json` enables `Image`.** The other bound
  engine class beyond `RefCounted` / `OS` is `Skeleton3D`, for `NativeArmRig`
  (below).

## Layout

- `src/` — extension sources. One `.h`/`.cpp` pair per ported kernel plus
  `register_types.*`.
- `godot-cpp/` — git submodule, branch `4.5` (no 4.6 branch exists upstream
  yet; GDExtension is forward-compatible, `compatibility_minimum = "4.5"`).
  Switch to the matching branch when upstream publishes it.
- `build_profile.json` — limits generated bindings to the classes actually
  used; keeps a clean build to ~1–2 min instead of ~10.
- `mitts_native.gdextension` — the manifest Godot auto-loads. Until a binary
  for the current platform exists under `bin/`, Godot logs a load error at
  startup and the `Native*` classes are simply absent — the game and the GUT
  suite still run, and parity/benchmark tests go *pending* instead of failing.
  **In CI that skip is a failure instead** (`MITTS_REQUIRE_NATIVE=1`, see
  `tests/native_parity_guard.gd`): the workflow builds the extension first, so
  an absent class there means the build or the registration broke, and a skip
  would report a gate that never ran as green.
- `bin/` — build output, gitignored. Every machine builds its own.
  `bin/.built-from` records the commit the binary was built from; the git hooks
  compare it against the working tree (`.githooks/native-stale-check.sh`), since
  a kernel built from other sources drops to the GDScript fallback silently.

## Building

First time (or after the submodule bumps):

```bash
git submodule update --init native/godot-cpp
bash native/build.sh              # or: cd native && scons build_profile=build_profile.json -jN
```

`build.sh` builds `template_debug` (what the editor and headless GUT runs
load). Pass `target=template_release` for the export build. On Windows, run
from a shell where either MSVC (`x64 Native Tools` prompt) or MinGW is on
PATH — scons picks up whichever it finds; add `use_mingw=yes` to force MinGW.

After the first successful build, restart the editor once so it picks up the
extension. Subsequent rebuilds hot-reload (`reloadable = true`), though
Windows sometimes holds the DLL lock — if the reload doesn't take, restart the
editor.

## Shipping

Players never build anything: `deploy.yml` and `deploy-steam.yml` cross-
compile the Windows `template_release` DLL with mingw-w64 (statically linked
runtime, no extra dependencies) before the Godot export, and the export packs
whatever the `.gdextension` manifest references. A missing DLL ships a
working game that silently runs the GDScript fallback — the boot log and the
debug digest's `native_kernels` field are how you catch that, in a shipped
build exactly as on a dev machine.

## Verifying a port

```bash
bash .claude/hooks/run-gut.sh -gtest=res://tests/unit/rules/test_native_ik_parity.gd
bash .claude/hooks/run-gut.sh -gdir=res://benchmarks   # includes the IK micro-bench
```

The micro-benchmark (`benchmarks/test_ik_micro_benchmark.gd`) reports
GDScript-vs-native µs/call including boundary-crossing cost (the IK solvers and
the arm rebuild). Compare
relatively within one run; a debug engine build inflates both sides
differently.

## Wired call sites

Every port is live behind a null-checked native handle created where its
GDScript config is built — the extension missing simply leaves the handle
null and the reference GDScript path runs (a fresh clone, or any platform
without a built binary, loses performance, never correctness — CI builds it):

- **Movement** — `SkaterController._apply_movement` / `_apply_block_movement`
  (per-tick thrust rides `apply_movement_with_thrust`), plus the batched
  `integrate_forward` in `RemoteController` (stage-3 render) and
  `LagCompRewind.forward_predict_skater` (host claim rewind) — both through
  the SAME per-skater instance (`SkaterController.native_movement()`), which
  is what keeps render == rewind.
- **Blade IK** — `SkaterIKCoordinator` (`project_blade`, the 3-pass
  `_solve_top_hand`, `update_bottom_hand`); config syncs inside the cached-
  config builders, so `invalidate_configs()` covers both representations.
- **Blade dangle** — `SkaterIKCoordinator.apply_blade_from_mouse` step 2 (the
  stateful speed-cap / arrive-law smoother, `NativeBladeDangle.advance`);
  reset/seed forward from `reset_blade_smoothing` / `seed_blade_smoothing`,
  config syncs via `_sync_dangle_config` under `invalidate_configs()`.
- **Puck step** — host drive (`Puck._drive_analytic`, per sub-step so the
  goalie interleave keeps its exact order) and client prediction
  (`PuckController._run_prediction`, whole-tick `step_tick` batching), both
  configured by `NativePuckStepFactory` so authority and prediction run the
  identical step.
- **Swept-OBB atom** — `GoalieContactDetector.nearest` (host saves + client
  goalie-stop prediction).
- **Gait core** — `SkaterSkatingCoordinator.apply` (render rate, every skater):
  `locomote` runs `SkaterLocomotion`, the hip alignment and pivot read and the
  reach sit in one call, and `solve` the `GaitPose` stance and leg solve (LegIK,
  the ice frame, the runner depth) on the hips' tilt the coordinator reads off
  the skater. The overlay layers stay GDScript and shape the pose the port
  loads into `GaitPose` (`load_native_legs` before the leg layers,
  `load_native_trunk` after them), so every pass runs the port and the parity
  fuzz (`tests/unit/rules/test_native_gait_parity.gd`) drives the overlays too.
  Tunables load by name in `configure(controller)`, re-run from
  `SkaterController.apply_attributes`.

- **Arm rig** — `SkaterArmRig._update_arm` (render rate, every drawn skater,
  both arms): `pose` runs the whole arm and **writes the bones itself** — the
  five arm parts and that side's deltoid cap, on the `Skeleton3D` handed to
  `bind`. That is the one exception to "results out": the math is cheaper
  than the crossings, so a port that hands six transforms back for GDScript to
  write measured 9.2 µs against the GDScript's 10.6; one crossing is ~4. The
  rig keeps its own view of the caps (`_basis`, `_girdle`) for the reposes it
  makes itself (trunk texture, sizing) and reads the native's back on demand
  (`_sync_cap`); a degenerate span returns false and takes the GDScript path.
  `tests/unit/rules/test_native_arm_rig_parity.gd`.

The parity suites force the GDScript path on their reference objects (e.g.
nulling `_skating._native`) — a parity test must never compare the native
port against itself.

## Adding a kernel

1. Port the rule class to `src/<name>.h/.cpp`, mirroring the GDScript math
   exactly (double scalars, `real_t` vector components — GDScript's precision
   model). Keep the reasoning comments in the GDScript file; the C++ port
   points back at it.
2. Register the class in `register_types.cpp`.
3. Add any newly-referenced engine classes to `build_profile.json`.
4. Add a seeded fuzz parity test beside the existing one, and a
   GDScript-vs-native row to the micro-benchmark.
5. Wire the call site behind a `ClassDB.class_exists` check so unbuilt
   checkouts fall back to the GDScript path.

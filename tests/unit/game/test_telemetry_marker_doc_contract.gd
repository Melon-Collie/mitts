# docs/telemetry_dictionary.md states every auto-marker tripwire in prose, and a
# playtester reading a `.json` summary reads THAT, not the source. So the doc is
# the third copy of these numbers, and the one most likely to rot: the audit that
# prompted this work measured ~29% of the identifiers that file names as no longer
# existing in the codebase.
#
# The other two copies are gone. NetworkTelemetry now owns the bands as named
# constants and NetworkDebugOverlay reads them, so the overlay's red and a
# recorded marker cannot describe different thresholds. This is what closes the
# loop on the third.
#
# Parsing prose is fragile on purpose here: it is exactly as fragile as a reader
# trusting the sentence. If the doc is reworded such that a threshold can no
# longer be found, that fails too — an unreadable spec and a wrong one are the
# same problem for the person holding the summary.
#
# The healthy-band COLUMN is held the same way wherever a band is expressed as an
# arithmetic relation to a named constant. That column is the other place these
# numbers rot, and it rots more quietly: a tripwire that never fires is noticed,
# a band that is always red is learned around.

# Two ratchets on the shape of Scripts/: how long a file may be, and how wide
# its public surface may be. Both only ever tighten.
#
# The audit that produced them found five root causes, and this is the guard for
# the one no cleanup can fix by itself: nothing stopped a file from growing.
# Every god class here got that way one reasonable commit at a time, and each of
# those commits was correct in isolation. A ratchet is the only thing that makes
# the aggregate visible at the moment it moves.
#
# HOW IT WORKS. A file not named in the table must stay under the limit — that
# is the real guard, covering ~310 of the 341 files. The tables are the
# grandfather list: every file already over the limit when the ratchet went in,
# pinned at the size it was. They are the backlog, made un-growable rather than
# hidden.
#
# WHEN IT FIRES, there are three things it can be saying:
#
#   · "grew past its allowance" — you added lines to a file that is already too
#     big. Splitting is the intended answer. Bumping the number is ALLOWED and
#     is not cheating: the ratchet's job is to make growth deliberate and
#     visible in the diff, not impossible. Say why in the commit message.
#   · "shrank well below its allowance" — you won something; bank it. Tighten
#     the entry to the new number so the space cannot be re-spent quietly. This
#     is the click that makes it a ratchet instead of a cap.
#   · "is now under the limit" — the file graduated. Delete its entry.
#
# WHAT THE NUMBERS MEAN. 800 lines is roughly the point past which an agent
# reads a file partially and edits it blind, which is the failure this codebase
# actually suffers. 25 public functions is the point past which "what does this
# class do" stops having a one-sentence answer. Neither is a law of nature;
# both are the line where the cost showed up here.
#
# Two entries in the API table are deliberate and will never come down, and it
# is worth knowing which before trying:
#   · network_manager.gd (200) — 111 are receive_*/send_*/notify_*. Godot
#     dispatches @rpc by name on the node, so that IS the wire protocol.
#   · player_attributes.gd (53) — one accessor per body dial, by design.
#
# Scope is Scripts/ only. A long test is not the same cost as a long subsystem,
# and addons/ is vendored.

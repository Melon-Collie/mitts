# Claim-rewind answerability across a latency x lead matrix.
#
# The bug these exist for is silent by construction: StateBufferManager answers a
# future query with its newest sample and no error, so a resolver asking for an
# instant the host has not simulated gets a plausible-looking wrong answer. The
# only way to catch it is to assert the lookup was in range BEFORE trusting it.
#
# test_resolving_on_arrival_overruns_the_buffer is the teeth: it asserts the
# legacy resolve-on-arrival path still overruns. If that goes green the harness
# has stopped modelling the gap and everything below it is worthless.

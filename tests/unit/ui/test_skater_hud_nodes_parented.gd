# The per-skater world HUD, as it now exists.
#
# The flat-on-ice half has left the node tree: the slot ring, elevation chevrons
# and the slapper one-timer indicator are ice-shader uniforms.
# What stays a node is what cannot be painted on the ice — the name plate, which
# is world-sized text standing up off the surface, and the self-beacon, which
# floats above the head. The beacon is additionally built LAZILY, only on the
# skater the ring-relation resolver reports as SELF.
#
# Both properties pinned below have broken before:
#
#   • Parenting. An unparented Node3D is not obviously broken: it constructs
#     fine, keeps its local transform, and stays silent until something writes
#     its global_position, which then fails with "Condition !is_inside_tree() is
#     true" and returns identity — the mark simply never appears, and the only
#     symptom is an error line in a log nobody reads. Checking names in the subtree rather than the
#     coordinator's own references is deliberate: the references would be
#     non-null in exactly the broken case.
#
#   • Visibility defaults. `_ring_visible` replaced a MeshInstance3D born
#     visible = true and defaulted to false. Its only writers are the
#     replay/spectator latch and the ghost pass, neither of which runs on an
#     ordinary skater, so the ring stayed hidden from spawn until the first goal
#     replay restored it.

# Guards the claim made in two places at once:
#
#   goalie_skill_profile.gd — "Hard == the GoalieController @export defaults
#                              verbatim. Keep these in sync with the controller
#                              so applying Hard is a true no-op."
#   goalie_controller.gd    — "Null = Hard, i.e. the authored @export defaults
#                              unchanged — so tutorial / replay / single-goalie
#                              spawns that don't pass one behave exactly as before."
#
# Both were false. `read_lag` was authored at 0.13 while hard() passed 0.05, so a
# goalie spawned without a profile read a wind-up 2.6× staler than the Hard tier
# it was supposed to be identical to — on the one knob GoalieSkillProfile itself
# calls "the term that decides whether LATERAL deception pays", and at a value
# outside the 0–0.10 responsive band that file documents. Nothing caught it because
# an eighteen-float positional constructor has no names to compare and a comment
# cannot fail.
#
# The test is the claim, stated literally: snapshot the authored defaults, apply
# Hard, assert nothing moved. It needs no per-field list of expected values, so it
# cannot drift out of date the way the comments did — a new knob added to
# _apply_skill_profile is covered the moment it is wired.

# The offensive stations' pinch read (docs/transition-defense-plan.md §13).
# Replaces the counter-channel race for every station holding forward ice while
# we have the puck. Team 0 defends +Z (net at +26.65) and attacks -Z.
#
# The doctrine being pinned:
#   "The only time a defenseman should be standing on the offensive blue line is
#    when his team has complete control of the puck."
#   "A defenceman can only pinch when they have a supporting player in position
#    to back them up."
#   "The first rule defensemen are taught is to count numbers."
#   "Better to stay safe with a 3 on 2, rather than pinch and end up with a
#    3 on 1" — the retreat target is a numbers layer, not your own net.

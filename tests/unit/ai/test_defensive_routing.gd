# ── How a defender GETS to his stand ─────────────────────────────────────────
# The gap ladder, the angling shade and the cover geometry all describe WHERE a
# defensive stand is. None of them describes the route to it, and for a long time
# nothing did: the steering flew every anchor as a parked point — full thrust at
# the spot, arrival-brake to a stop on it — which is correct for a station and
# wrong for every defensive stand, because a gap point, a cover point and a
# backchecker's hip all RIDE an opponent and sweep toward our net at his pace.
#
# The symptom was a defender who could only defend from ice he was already
# standing on. Starting near his man he tracked back fine; starting deep, with a
# real trip to make, he sprinted at the stand, braked to a stop on it, and was
# standing still when the rush arrived — beaten by any lateral cut, which is
# every rush. Same role, same ladder, same stand: the route was the whole
# difference. AISteering's moving-frame pursuit is the fix.
#
# What this file pins, after the gap ladder reached AIRolePressure, is THE ROUTE
# and THE DEPTH — two things a single dispatch cannot see, because both are
# properties of a body over several seconds:
#
#   ANGLING — is he on the middle side of his man at the zone entry, steering him
#     to the boards rather than trailing him to the slot.
#   DEPTH — how far he lets himself be walked back toward his own net.
#   THE LAYER — with two defenders, is anybody ever between the puck and the net.
#   THE NEUTRAL SHAPE — does anybody stay home on a loose puck.
#
# It also REPORTS a time-in-shape share (within a working gap AND travelling with
# the man rather than at him). That reading was this file's original assertion and
# is now reported only; the note in the sweep below explains why, and where its
# guard duty went. Short version: doctrine in our own zone is to stand the carrier
# UP, which is deliberately not travelling with him, so the metric no longer has a
# stable referent.
#
# Reference readings, all from the sweeps below:
#
#                                      parked-point route   moving frame + ladder
#   in-zone time with nobody goal-side       5% (worst 48%)     0% (worst 0%)
#   closest approach to own net, worst       0.1 m              6.8 m
#   inside offset at the zone entry         +1.65 m            +0.79 m
#
# The inside offset does NOT improve and is not claimed to: the parked-point route
# reads a LARGER shade because it is measured off a body standing still a long way
# off the man, and a wide shade on someone you are not with is not angling. It is
# asserted only as a floor — a defender must end up on the middle side of his man.
#
# WHAT THE HARNESS DOES NOT MODEL: body collisions (the carrier skates through
# the defender), so "did he stop the rush" is not a question it can answer and is
# never asserted. What it answers faithfully is where the bodies are and how fast
# they are going, which is the whole of the defect.

# ── Standing him up: the defender must not be walked to his own net ──────────
#
# The other half of the shadow, and the one the in-shape read above deliberately
# stops measuring. A cut-off point defined relative to the carrier — his led
# position, one stick goal-side — is correct CLOSING geometry, and tracking it
# perfectly is therefore an instruction to retreat at the carrier's own speed for
# as long as he keeps coming. Nothing said when to stop. Measured on the real
# stack against a carrier who simply drives the middle, the pressurer rode a
# constant ~6 m cushion from the tops of the circles to his own GOAL LINE and
# never contested anything: you could walk him into his own net by skating at
# him. AIRolePressure's house-gate floor is the fix.
#
#   Over the 9-start sweep below:                    no floor  →  with it
#     defender's closest approach to his own net, mean   3.6 m      7.3 m
#     worst single start                                 0.1 m      5.5 m
#
# The bar BOUNDS THE PATHOLOGY, not the tuning (this file's assertion philosophy).
# What it has to catch is a defender standing in his own crease — the 0.1 m
# reading, which is the reported defect — so it sits well above that and below
# what the floor actually delivers. Pinning it nearer the house gate would be
# pinning the floor's exact depth, which is a different and more brittle claim:
# the floor releases once the carrier is inside the gate (a corner battle is a
# place a pressurer belongs), so following him down from there is correct and
# this reading is legitimately below the gate.

# ── The neutral zone: does the shape leave a man home? ───────────────────────
#
# A different failure from the two above, and a TEAM one: the individual routes
# can all be good and the shape still lose, because every station stepped up at
# once. NEUTRAL's flank stand is a rigid offset off the puck, so both flanks
# follow it wherever it goes; and the bound on that stand only asked whether a
# man had ALREADY got behind them, which in a neutral-zone puck race is nobody —
# both teams are converging on a loose puck. So every station read clear, all
# three bodies ended up within a few metres of the puck, and whoever won it had
# beaten the whole team. `AIRoleHelpers.home_layer_behind_me` is the missing
# clause; `AIRoleFlank` supplies the layer's stand.
#
# WHAT IS MEASURED, and why it is the shape rather than the outcome. The obvious
# reading — the share of the following rush spent with nobody between their puck
# and our net — does not work. Over a 5 s six-body sim with no body contact that
# number is set by everything downstream of the shape (who wins the next battle,
# whether a feed connects) and swings 0-66% between starts of the SAME condition;
# measured both ways over six starts it read 19% before this bound and 21% after,
# which is noise, not a result. The turnover instant saturates in the other
# direction: an opponent first touches the puck while everyone is still deep, so
# it reads 3/3 either way.
#
# So the read is the SHAPE, during the loose-puck window that the bound governs:
# how far from our own net does our DEEPEST body get. A team with a layer keeps
# one back around its own blue line; a team that steps up as a group has its
# deepest man climbing with the other two, and the number is then just "where the
# puck is". That is the complaint stated literally, it is what this bound
# controls, and it is settled before the downstream variance starts.
#
#   Reference over the 8-start sweep:   no numbers half  →  with it
#     mean deepest-body drift                  21.9 m            19.0 m
#     worst single start                       24.2 m            20.5 m
#     starts with nobody left back              3/8               0/8
#
# The window is the FIRST 2.5 s, which is where the shape is set, and it ends
# early if we win the puck — from there it is an attack. Run it longer
# and a puck that rims into their end starts dragging the whole team after it,
# which is correct play and not this bound's business — the reading gets noisier
# without getting more informative.
#
# Be careful what this table is claiming. It is a measurement of the SHAPE, and
# the shape moves by about a stride and a half. What it is NOT is a measured
# improvement in goals or in rushes survived: over six-body sims with no body
# contact, that outcome is not resolvable at this sample size in either

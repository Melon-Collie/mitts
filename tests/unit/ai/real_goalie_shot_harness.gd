# ── REAL-goalie shot-outcome instrument ──────────────────────────────────────
# Ground truth for "does the live goalie actually stop this shot." Drives the
# REAL GoalieController (from Goalie.tscn) and the REAL analytic puck→goalie
# save loop — GoalieContactDetector.nearest + GoalieSaveRules.resolve_contact,
# the exact pair Puck._physics_process runs on the host — with the goalie's real
# reaction delay, butterfly drop, lateral push and pose anatomy (glove/pad
# boxes) in the loop. Unlike shot_sim_harness (a lateral-reach BAND model that
# score_shoot is calibrated against), nothing here is a re-derived cover proxy:
# the puck is marched tick-by-tick and tested against the goalie's actual posed
# collision boxes, and the goalie reacts to the real puck motion each tick.
#
# This is the reference the band instrument and score_shoot's HIGH/LOW cover are
# reconciled to — the "measure" half of measure-then-match. No class_name (test
# infra stays out of the global namespace); the nodes are owned by the test
# (add_child_autofree) and handed in via setup().
#
# APPROXIMATION SCOPE: a single, set goalie (no rush backflow), a free shot from
# the release point (no carrier attach), and the puck marched with the real
# frame step (posts/crossbar/net panels) + the real goalie collision. Rebounds
# are terminal — first goalie contact classifies SAVE (a live kick that reverses
# the puck's goalward z is a save-out; a deaden/catch is a save). Read the SAVE
# RATE per (range × loft) as the measurement.

# a fixed count does not mean the same thing at every spot or after every prior
# trial.
#
# Two things it fixes over a raw `settle`:
#
#   CONVERGENCE IS DETECTED, NOT ASSUMED. Recovery from the goal line to challenge
#   depth takes ~1.7 s, so any fixed count below ~200 ticks silently measures a
#   keeper still on his way out (radius 0.54 at 0.2 s vs 1.75 settled). This ticks
#   until the challenge radius and lateral position both stop moving.
#
#   THE SHOOTER IS PUT IN A NON-WINDUP STATE FIRST. `settle` leaves
#   `current_shot_state` at whatever the previous trial set, and a wind-up left
#   published makes the goalie read a shot threat during the settle — he decides
#   to block, drops to butterfly, and then stops reading the wind-up entirely

# ── REBOUND tracking ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# `fire`/`fire_at` stop at first contact, which is right for measuring reach but
# silently scores every rebound goal as a save. This variant applies the REAL
# save response (GoalieSaveRules.resolve_contact + the flush eject, the exact
# pair Puck._physics_process runs) and keeps marching, so it can answer the
# question that actually matters: where does the puck END UP.
#
# A SAVE IS NOT OVER WHEN THE PUCK LEAVES THE PAD. The goalie's own next beat is
# part of it: a puck that dies in front of him is one he sweeps to the corner
# (GoalieCreaseClear — inside `reach` of him, on the ice, under `max_puck_speed`,
# after a dwell), and a puck he gets a glove on is one he holds. So this keeps
# the CONTROLLER ticking for the whole window and reads the puck back from it
# each tick, rather than marching over the goalie's own actions with its own
# integration. Measuring the rebound alone scores "dead at his feet" as a
# second chance in the slot, when it is the setup for the clear.
#
# Fills `last_part` with the FIRST contact as usual, plus:
#   rebound_pos     where the puck ended the window
#   rebound_speed   its speed there
#   rebound_goal    it went in (first shot OR rebound)
#   rebound_caught  he closed a glove on it
#   rebound_held    he pinned it (glove hold or a cover smother)
#   rebound_swept   he played it away with the stick
#
# The return value is the FIRST-shot verdict — SAVE once the goalie touched it,
# whatever happened next. Read `rebound_goal` beside it: SAVE with rebound_goal
# is a second chance buried, and a caller counting only the return value scores
# that as a stop.

# ── Windup → release path (the DISGUISE instrument) ──────────────────────────
# `settle` + `fire` above never exercise the RELEASE event: the puck simply
# appears in flight and the goalie picks it up through the universal-reaction
# path, which explicitly grants no pre-arm. That is the right scope for raw
# reach measurement, but it cannot see anything about what the goalie READ
# before the shot — so it cannot measure disguise.
#
# This pair drives the real read pipeline instead:
#   hold_windup()  — the carrier sits in WRISTER_AIM with the puck pinned,
#                    publishing `declared_aim` as predicted_shot_velocity. This is
#                    the aim the goalie fixates on: it feeds the pre-lean, the
#                    pinned-windup squaring, and the quiet-eye pre-arm timer.
#   fire_release() — clears the carry and emits puck_released with the ACTUAL
#                    shot velocity, so GoalieController._on_puck_released runs
#                    (consuming any pre-arm) exactly as it does in a real game.
#
# Pointing `declared_aim` and the release aim at the SAME corner is a telegraphed
# shot; pointing them at OPPOSITE corners is a late swing — the disguised,
# against-the-grain release. The save-rate delta between those two arms is the
# measurement.


# Speed-explicit windup/release pair — the HUMAN mechanism. A player skates in,
# holds LMB (which freezes the blade and publishes predicted_shot_velocity, so
# the goalie pre-leans and builds his pre-arm read), then releases at the target.
# `fire`/`fire_at` model none of that: the puck simply appears in flight and the
# keeper picks it up cold. Any sweep that wants to match what a human actually
# executes has to come through here.
# NOTE: no reset_to_crease here, deliberately. A human skates in and sets up
# BEFORE pulling the trigger, so the keeper is already square and at challenge
# depth when the windup starts. Resetting inside the windup measures a keeper
# caught mid-transition, which reads as "the pre-arm made him worse" when really
# he never got set. Callers do reset + settle first, then hold.

# Hold a wrister windup aimed at `declared_aim` for `ticks`, with the goalie

#
# ⚠️ `ticks` SELECTS WHICH GOALIE YOU MEASURE. This resets to the crease first
# (see below) and does NOT settle, so the hold is also his entire recovery from
# the goal line — and that recovery takes ~1.7 s. Measured challenge radius by
# hold length, centred shooter at 5 m:
#
#     0.10 s -> 0.32    0.20 s -> 0.54    0.40 s -> 0.98
#     0.60 s -> 1.38    1.00 s -> 1.68    1.67 s -> 1.75 (settled)

# tests holding for different lengths are not comparing the same keeper at all.
# Numbers from this path are about a goalie STILL COMING OUT unless the hold is
# long — which is a legitimate thing to measure, but say which one you meant.
#
# SETTLING FIRST IS NOT A FREE FIX, so it is deliberately not done here: against
# a stationary carrier he drops to idle BUTTERFLY at ~1.0 s of hold, and while
# down he stops reading the wind-up entirely (`_is_reading_shot_threat` is
# upright-only) — the shot-read timer resets, the slapper aim shade switches off,
# and he re-centres. Measured with a slapper wind-up declared at a corner from

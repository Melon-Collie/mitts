# ── Does a five-man D-zone shape actually COVER the attack? ───────────────────
# The 5v5 counterpart of test_defensive_routing.gd, and it exists because that
# file cannot see this: its sims are a carrier plus two defencemen, so
# RUSH_D2's man-picker returns -1, the cover path is never entered, and its
# metrics came out byte-identical across changes that provably altered coverage.
# Everything about who-covers-whom was therefore pinned only by single-dispatch
# unit tests, which cannot see a body over time.
#
# What this pins, all of it over multi-second sims on the real decision stack:
#
#   DISTINCTNESS — no attacker is covered by two defenders at once. Structural
#     since the zone roles joined TeamBrain's matching (their AREA is now
#     eligibility rather than a private search), and asserted hard because a
#     regression here is silent: five roles each running their own argmax over
#     the deliberately overlapping areas double-covered somebody on 61% of
#     D-zone ticks and stacked 52% of every lock issued, three deep at times.
#     Every redundant lock is a man left open somewhere else.
#
#     Asserted as a SHARE rather than as zero, because the guarantee lives at
#     the brain and the bodies are one step behind it. The matcher cannot emit
#     a duplicate, but dispatch is throttled and phase-offset per bot, so during
#     a handoff two defenders can briefly act on assignments from different
#     brain ticks. That skew is not a coverage failure and is not worth chasing.
#
# Read off each defender's OWN decision (RoleDecision.locked_man_pid, round-
# tripped as the agent's _prev_locked_man_pid), never off the brain's published
# partition. That distinction is the difference between a real guard and a
# tautology: the matcher hands out distinct men by construction, so asking IT
# whether two bodies share a man can only ever answer no. Asking the bodies
# works whoever made the choice, which is what lets this file fail if the
# per-role argmaxes ever come back.
#   UNATTENDED MEN — how many attackers INSIDE THE ZONE no defender has. This
#     is the claim the file is really making, and it is asserted directly
#     because the obvious proxy is not the same statement. Breadth — the count
#     of distinct men covered — is still reported, but it silently divides by
#     however many attackers happen to be in the zone, so it moves when the
#     ATTACK changes with the coverage untouched. It did exactly that: a
#     reception fix upstream turned the point-shot fixture from a scramble
#     (puck loose 51% of its life) into a real possession sequence, one attacker
#     left the zone, and breadth fell 2.43 -> 2.02 through a 2.2 floor while the
#     number of men going unattended barely moved. A count of men nobody has is
#     denominator-free and says what the assertion message says.
#   OPEN DANGER — the finish-danger of the most dangerous unattended man. The
#     outcome reading: the count above counts bodies, this counts what they
#     are worth.
#
# The bounds are PINNED MEASUREMENTS. The double-lock ceiling was chosen to sit
# between what the matching produces and what the five private argmaxes it
# replaced produced, run on these same three fixtures through the same bodies:
#
#                        matched            per-role argmaxes
#   double-locked        9% / 0% / 0%       15% / 49% / 23%
#   covered per tick     2.70 / 2.43 / 2.90 2.62 / 1.44 / 2.05
#
# The covered-per-tick row is kept for context only — it is the retired metric,
# and the argmax column CANNOT be re-derived under the unattended-men count
# (that model is gone from the tree, and its own in-zone attacker counts went
# with it). So the unattended ceiling is calibrated differently, against
# measured readings on these three fixtures:
#
#   unattended/tick   1.74 / 1.71 / 1.87   when the matching landed
#                     1.59 / 1.79 / 2.28   with the reception rendezvous
#                     1.59 / 1.57 / 2.00   with the gap-ladder / pinch fixes
#                     1.69 / 1.92 / 2.54   with the stick-aware chase intercept
#
# That last row is the first one the shared ceiling could not hold, and the
# crossing cutter now carries its own pin (see below). Two things about it are
# worth keeping, because neither is visible in the number:
#   - It is not a graded response. Shrinking the reach credit (1.80 m ->
#     1.60 m) moved the cutter only 2.54 -> 2.52 while breaking BOTH
#     point-holds-the-line fixtures, so these sims are landing in a DIFFERENT
#     rollout rather than defending the same one better or worse — this
#     fixture's D-zone window moved 340 -> 320 ticks, and low cycle's
#     300 -> 460. Do not tune the chase against this table; it does not
#     measure what a tuner would think it measures.
#   - The danger readings moved in OPPOSITE directions, which is why the row
#     above cannot be read as a coverage regression on its own: the cutter's
#     open danger halved (mean 0.109 -> 0.052, worst 0.997 -> 0.308) while low
#     cycle's rose (0.039 -> 0.145, worst 0.370 -> 0.782). Low cycle still
#     clears OPEN_DANGER_CEILING with room, but it is the closest it has been,
#     and nobody has explained it. If that number moves again, explain it
#     before pinning it.
#
# The point-shot fixture's attack is now SCRIPTED (a held possession — see the
# test), so its readings are not rollouts of the bot attack and no longer belong
# to the table above: it reads 0.63 unattended/tick and carries its own pin.
#
# A regression to the argmaxes still breaks the double-lock ceiling, which is
# the guard that separated the two models sharply in the first place.
#
# Those three rows are also the argument for counting unattended men rather than
# covered ones, because the two middle changes moved the fixtures in opposite
# directions and only one metric read both honestly. The reception rendezvous
# cost the crossing cutter real coverage (1.87 -> 2.28) while breadth there
# stayed clear of its floor; the gap-ladder work then took the puck away from
# the attack in the point-shot fixture, which shrank its D-zone window from 360
# ticks to 260 and dragged BREADTH down through the same floor for a strictly
# better outcome — a hole the covered-per-tick metric could only be talked out
# of with a per-fixture exemption. Counting the men nobody has needs no
# exemption: it read the first as the regression it was and the second as the
# improvement it was (1.79 -> 1.57), because it never divides by how many
# attackers happen to be standing in the zone.
#
# The margins are deliberately modest; when one fails the question is "did the
# behaviour change on purpose", not "which bound do I loosen". Open danger is a
# much looser guard (it barely separated the two models) and is really there to
# catch a collapse.
#
# Worth knowing before reading too much into the old column: an earlier probe
# put the private argmaxes at 61% double-locked, but that sampled each role's
# picker fresh every tick. The BODIES were never that bad, because they only
# re-decide on their throttled dispatch. 15-49% is what actually reached the
# ice.
#
# WHAT THE HARNESS DOES NOT MODEL: body collisions. Attackers skate through
# defenders, so "did the coverage stop the play" is not a question this can
# answer and is never asserted. What it answers faithfully is who is standing
# on whom.
#
# Team 1 defends -Z (same convention as test_defensive_routing).

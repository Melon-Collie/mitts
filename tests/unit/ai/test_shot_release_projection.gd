# Does the shot leave from where its aim was computed?
#
# The bot commits its shot DIRECTION at press entry:
#
#   _shoot_release_anchor = self_pos + velocity * BOT_WRISTER_LOOKAHEAD_S
#   release_pos           = _shoot_release_anchor + _shot_release_offset_locked
#   _shoot_aim_dir_locked = (aim_point - release_pos).normalized()
#
# — a straight-line, constant-velocity projection of where the body will be one
# charge later. The puck then actually leaves from the live blade, which
# _apply_wrister_aim_blade holds body-relative (skater.global_position + offset),
# so the release origin follows the body wherever it really goes.
#
# Direction is locked; origin is live. Any gap between the projected body and the
# real one would therefore SHIFT THE WHOLE SHOT LINE laterally, arriving at the
# net displaced by that gap — and because the aim sits in a goalie-hole window
# whose clean-entry inset already pushes it near a post, a couple of tenths of a
# metre sideways is the difference between a corner and a miss.
#
# Nothing tested it, and nothing could: the shot-outcome instruments
# (shot_sim_harness, real_goalie_shot_harness) both fire from a GIVEN release
# point, so a projection error is invisible to them by construction. This drives
# the real state machine and the real movement physics through a full press
# instead, and measures the gap.
#
# The answer is that the projection is HONEST — under 5 cm in every case,
# including through traffic and on a hard lateral cut, which are the two shapes
# a straight-line constant-velocity projection should struggle with most. The
# bot steers to its own locked anchor and arrives. These stay as a regression
# pin: they rule out release displacement as a source of wide misses, so a
# future investigation does not have to re-derive it.

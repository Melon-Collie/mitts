# Feasibility probe for "option A": can the REAL GoalieController tick headless
# (with the real Goalie/Puck scenes) and produce a challenging position?
#
# RESULT: YES — option A is feasible. The real controller instantiates from the
# scenes, ticks via _physics_process, and CHALLENGES (settles at 1.75 m aggressive
# depth, squared on a slot threat). No physics/contact needed for positioning.
#
# It also let us RULE OUT a false lead. On a scripted lateral flyby the carrier
# never shoots (carry 0.957 vs shoot 0.30) because the winning carry candidate is
# a spot off to the SIDE. That LOOKS like an over-valued side-angle phantom — but
# it is NOT: at ~0.34 s arrival the keeper (after his 0.13 s reaction) can push
# only ~0.31 m of the ~0.91 m needed to re-square, so a fast diagonal cut leaves a
# GENUINE window that predict_goalie_pos prices correctly (a squared keeper would
# be ~0.04; the partially-squared one the carrier actually beats is ~0.9). Forcing
# the keeper fully square there (goalie_squared_pos) kills that real window and
# regresses the doorstep-cut behaviour (test_role_carrier's standstill wind-up) —
# so the model is right and the SCRIPTED LATERAL PATH is the artifact: the bot
# correctly wants to cut IN for a better look, and the script won't let it, so it
# "never shoots." A faithful repro of the in-game "no shot going by" needs the
# bot's REAL steering (real movement) + the real goalie in one temporal loop —
# neither scripted-path probe can capture the cut-in that's central to it.

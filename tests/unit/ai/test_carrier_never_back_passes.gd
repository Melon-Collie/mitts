# ── "Just take the shot" — the back-pass invariant ───────────────────────────
# The standing complaint: bots opt out. Facing a challenging goalie they decline
# both the shot AND the drive, and bail to a teammate BEHIND them — a pass that
# cannot score, made instead of a play that might.
#
# The rule this pins, in the user's words: a teammate 2 m further from the goal
# on the same line should never out-score both shooting and driving. One of those
# must win. You only pass if the receiver can genuinely shoot better than you.
#
# Note what is NOT claimed: passing is not banned, and the pass does not have to
# lose to shooting specifically. Driving is a fine answer to a challenging keeper
# (it is the real one — beat him around rather than through). The invariant is
# only that SOME forward-going play beats the bail-out.
#
# Driven against the REAL GoalieController so the keeper doing the challenging is
# the one the bots actually face, not a static stand-in.

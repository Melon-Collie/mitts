# ── THE DIFFICULTY LADDER ON THE PLAY THAT ACTUALLY GETS PLAYED ─────────────
# This project's own player scores overwhelmingly on breakaways, and the move is
# always the same one `test_human_wraparound` models: drive at him, pull the puck
# across to commit him, walk around him, tuck it. So the ladder that matters is
# the ladder ON THAT MOVE:
#
#   EASY   5 of 7 aim points open
#   NORMAL 2 of 7
#   HARD   2 of 7
#
# He seals the post on the wrap, so what decides it is whether he gets there:
# how far he has to retreat (depth) and how hard he pushes (the slide push,
# tiered like every other movement speed). The deeper tiers sit closer to the
# post, the weaker ones push slower, and the two cancel at NORMAL.
#
# Every measurement below fires the same seven-point aim fan at the same release
# point after the same bait, so the count IS how much net is open — not whether
# a shooter who already knows the answer can find it.
#
# ── TWO KNOBS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# `depth_base_m` and `slide_push_speed_mps` are the tier levers this play can
# feel. The others — every read latency, every reach speed, the drop time, the
# five-hole, the poke, the toe-out — change nothing here, to the shot. Depth cuts
# the other way: a goalie who challenges the rush harder is easier to walk
# around.
#
# ── THE TRADE IS REAL, AND IT HAS A MINIMUM ────────────────────────────────
# Pulling `depth_base_m` in is not free — it concedes the centre-lane rush shot
# from 5 m, which is exactly what challenge depth exists to cut off. Open aim
# points, walkaround plus a 6-cell rush grid (49 shots in total per row):
#
#   depth_base   walkaround   rush   total
#   1.30 (HARD)      2         7       9
#   1.00             2         6       8
#   0.80             2         8      10
#   0.60 (EASY)      1        11      12
#
# The authored 1.30 is still a point off the optimum, but the gap has closed from
# 11-vs-8 to 9-vs-8 — most of what challenge depth appeared to cost on this play
# was the stuck verdict, not the depth.
#
# ⚠️ THIS IS NOT A LICENCE TO SET IT TO 1.00. 1.30 is not a tuning number — it is
# `CreaseRules.STRAIGHT_DEPTH`, heels at the crease top, the taught B position.
# Replacing a rink landmark with a number that won a 49-shot sweep trades a model
# for a magic constant, which is the thing this codebase spends its effort not
# doing. Read the table as evidence about what the COMMIT costs from that depth,
# and fix the commit.

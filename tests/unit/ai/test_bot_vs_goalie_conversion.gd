# ── BOT-vs-GOALIE CONVERSION, the number nothing else measures ───────────────
# A real bot picks the shot; the real goalie tries to stop it; the puck is
# marched against his posed collision. See bot_vs_goalie_harness.gd for what is
# real and what is approximated — the approximations decide how far these
# numbers can be pushed and are worth reading before quoting any of them.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. The bot decides against `AIActionScoring`'s model of the
# goalie; the goalie plays as `GoalieController`; and until this file nothing
# compared their OUTCOMES. Every other sweep either scripts the shooter (the
# real-goalie harness, the xG benchmark, the beatability sweep) or models the
# save (rush_sim_harness), so the balance was set by the gap between two models
# that no test could see. That is why the sweeps read "wall" while the logged
# games read 0.614.
#
# HOW TO USE IT. The zone bands are deliberately identical to
# tools/goalie_shot_events_audit.sql, so this and the `shot_events` table are
# directly comparable. When they disagree, the disagreement is the finding — one
# of the two is wrong about the game and it is usually this one, because a
# harness with one skater cannot produce a rebound somebody buries.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS. Structural properties only, deliberately. Conversion levels
# are reported and NOT pinned: a level pinned here would be re-pinned on every
# tuning pass and would say nothing, and this file's whole purpose is to be the
# thing you re-measure against rather than a gate you satisfy. What it does gate
# is that the instrument still WORKS — bots still shoot and the goalie still
# makes saves — because a conversion instrument that has quietly stopped
# producing shots reports a fantastic save percentage. Tier ORDER is reported,
# not gated: see test_report_conversion_by_tier.

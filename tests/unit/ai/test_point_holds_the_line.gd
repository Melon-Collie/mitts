# Do the 5v5 defencemen actually get to the offensive blue line?
#
# The reported failure is that they do not — the forwards end up cycling alone
# while both D sit well back, so the attack is outnumbered in the zone.
#
# The station target runs through AIRoleHelpers.offensive_station_target, which
# is the pinch read (plan §13): hold the forward stand while we have real
# control and either support behind us or nobody behind us; otherwise back off
# to the numbers layer; and if the puck is not ours at all, retreat to structure.
# _decide_point's own stand is line_z = -own_dir * (BLUE_LINE_Z + POINT_INSET_M),
# so for team 0 (attacking -z) a held point sits at z = -9.29.
#
# This measures where they really end up over a settled offensive-zone
# possession, so the question stops being read off the code and starts being a
# number.

# A settled offensive-zone cycle: our three forwards low in their end, our two D
# starting at the line, their five collapsed in their own zone. Our carrier works
# the puck along the wall — the situation the points exist for.
#
# Their five are scripted CONTAINERS holding a wide gap, not live forecheckers,
# and their sticks cannot strip. That is deliberate: the pinch read's first
# question is whether the puck is genuinely ours, so a fixture where opponents
# take it measures the retreat (which is correct behaviour) instead of the hold.
# Holding possession is the precondition of the question, so the fixture has to
# grant it; the contested version is test_what_a_live_forecheck_does_to_the_points.
#
# THE GRANT HAS A SHELF LIFE, and CYCLE_S is it. The containers hold their gap
# forever, but our own five do not hold the puck forever: our share of it decays
# down the run (roughly 64% at 2 s, 42% at 3 s, ~30% past 4 s) as the cycle turns
# into passes and scrambles between our own players. Past that the fixture is no
# longer measuring a settled possession, and what it reports is a broken cycle —
# D1 chasing deep and D2 sagging out behind him, which both do eventually in ANY
# build. Measure inside the grant; a longer window is a different question.

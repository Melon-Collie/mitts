# Flyby shot probe: scripts a carrier-with-puck skating PAST the net while the
# real SkaterAgentStateMachine (with its real decision throttle) decides each
# tick, and records whether/when a shot actually fires. Built to separate the
# user's report — "inconsistent getting a shot off in close, especially going
# by" — into the LAG (the carry→shoot compete only re-runs every
# dispatch_period_ticks) vs the MODEL (the shoot-vs-carry EV balance).
#
# FINDINGS (the prints are the deliverable; see the trailing asserts):
#   - NOT the lag. Hard runs the fastest dispatch, spends the WHOLE pass in
#     point-blank range, and still fires ~0 shots — because carry EV (~0.5-0.96)
#     dominates shoot EV (~0.25). Instant dispatch wouldn't change that.
#   - It's the shoot-vs-carry balance, and it's CONFOUNDED by the static goalie:
#     a keeper that sits at 0.8 m and never challenges makes "walk it in" read as
#     a free tap-in, so carry wins. Pressure (a backchecker) drops carry toward
#     shoot but doesn't flip it here.
#   - So a valid study of this decision needs the REAL goalie in a temporal loop
#     (option A). The static-goalie harness structurally can't produce the true
#     balance — the challenging goalie is exactly what makes the shot the play.

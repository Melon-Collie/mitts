# Scenes/Skater.tscn is hand-edited in the Godot editor; the constants that
# restate it live in text files edited separately. Nothing reads both, so a
# proportion moved in the editor and a constant left behind cannot disagree
# loudly — they disagree in the render, or worse, in the reach math.
#
# The sibling of test_goalie_scene_mirrors.gd, and the same argument: the scene
# is the authored truth for where a shoulder or a knee sits, and the code around
# it is a copy that has to keep up.
#
# The rig is doubly scene-coupled: SkaterArmRig.build / SkaterLegRig.build read
# each node's authored transform out of the scene and then FREE the subtree, so
# a renamed or reparented node is not a missing-node error at runtime — it is a
# bone that silently keeps its identity transform.

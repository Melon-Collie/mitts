# Deterministic simulation of the CLAIM GEOMETRY seam: when a client sees its
# blade reach the puck, does the host's rewind agree?
#
# Third of the netcode harnesses. NetTimingHarness covers the input pipeline,
# NetRewindHarness covers buffer answerability — "was the lookup in range". This
# one covers the question those two deliberately leave open: was the ANSWER
# right. It is the quantity behind the playtest's 45% pickup-claim miss rate,
# and until now the only way to measure it was to ship a build and read the
# host's telemetry afterwards.
#
# Structure mirrors the real seam:
#   host    — advances the puck and a sweeping blade, captures both every tick
#   link    — snapshots reach the client one_way later
#   client  — knows its OWN blade exactly (locally predicted), and PREDICTS the
#             puck from its newest received snapshot to its render instant
#   client  — runs PuckInteractionRules.check_pickup on what it rendered; a hit
#             sends a claim
#   host    — rewinds blade to self_view_time and puck to puck_view_time, runs
#             the SAME check_pickup, and either confirms or misses
#
# Because the blade is exact on both sides, EVERY disagreement is puck
# prediction error. That is the isolation the harness is for: a false negative
# here is a claim the player earned and the host refused.
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT MODELLED, and why: the puck solver. Client and host
# run the identical shared step from the identical snapshot, so it contributes
# exactly zero divergence by construction — simulating it would test
# determinism, which is not in question, and would hide the variable that is.
# What decides a miss is PREDICTION SPAN against events the client could not
# know about, so the puck moves at constant velocity and the host injects
# unmodelled deflections (a stick, a body, a save). Longer span + more
# unmodelled events = more misses, and that relationship is the measurement.
#
# THE CRITICAL PROPERTY, as with the other two: it reproduces a known effect on
# demand. `RenderMode` switches the client's puck target between host-present
# (pre-v59) and host-present + input lead (shipping), and the suite asserts the
# longer span measurably raises the miss rate — the regression flagged when the
# clock unification landed, which could not be proven from a single playtest.
#
# VALIDATION — the thing that makes the rest of it worth reading. Run at the
# conditions the 45%-miss playtest actually had (a 75 ms lead — the since-removed
# lead servo pinned at its ceiling — 30-60 ms RTT, contested-puck deflections) the
# harness produces 33-41%, and the same conditions at the designed 25 ms lead
# produce 6-15%. It reproduces the observed number and attributes most of it to
# the pinned lead, which is a prediction the next playtest can falsify.
#
# WHAT IT IS NOT. The client puts its blade on the puck it rendered, so its own
# view connects on EVERY eligible tick — `miss_rate` is therefore the fraction of
# ticks whose prediction error exceeded the radius, an error-exceedance curve,
# not a simulation of how often a player reaches for a puck. That is a
# well-defined quantity and the right one for comparing arrangements; it is not
# a forecast of any particular player's felt miss rate. Also absent: jitter,
# packet loss, and any second claimant — so nothing here says what a
# favor-the-actor grant does to the OTHER player in a scramble.
#
# SINGLE RUNS ARE NOISY. A run turns on ~60 random deflection directions, and
# across seeds the miss rate moves +/-20-25% relative (13.8% median becoming
# anywhere from 10.3% to 16.5%). Average a dozen seeds before quoting a number,
# and do not read a crossover between two arrangements to better than about
# +/-30 ms of RTT.
#
# A REFUSAL IS ONLY HALF THE SCORE. Every way of not refusing an earned claim
# grants something the world had already moved past, so a miss rate on its own
# ranks the most permissive option first. The grant metrics below are the other
# half: how far the puck the host adjudicated against sat from the TRUE puck at
# the instant the blade was physically there. Refusals are felt by the claimant,
# grants by everyone else, and an option is only picked by reading both.

extends RefCounted

# Deterministic simulation of the INPUT TIMING PIPELINE — the seam every netcode
# defect found so far has actually lived in.
#
# Not a physics harness. Nothing here skates or shoots. It models the plumbing:
# how a client's physics steps are scheduled against its render loop, what
# instant each input is stamped with, how the link delays/reorders/drops the
# batch, how the host dedupes and gates consumption, and how overdue each input
# is when the host pops it. Those are clocks, queues, buffers and ordering — and clocks, queues,
# buffers and ordering are where the bugs have been.
#
# It exists because the alternative is finding these by feel. Every defect in
# this area so far surfaced from reading code or reading telemetry after a
# session, one at a time, months apart. An assertion that fails in 20 seconds is
# a different development loop.
#
# THE CRITICAL PROPERTY: the harness can reproduce the KNOWN bug. `StampMode`
# switches between the legacy wall-clock stamping and the shipping tick-domain
# clock, and the suite asserts that the legacy mode loses inputs while the
# current one does not. A harness that only ever passes proves nothing about the
# next defect; one that fails on demand has teeth.
#
# Real code under test, not reimplementations:
#   - NetworkManager.next_sim_offset  (the tick-domain slew)
#   - ClockSync.input_lead_for_rtt  (the stamp lead)
# The dedupe, gate and drain rules mirror RemoteController; they live in a Node
# that can't be stood up headless, and the mirrors are pinned to the same
# constants so a divergence shows up as a failing expectation rather than drift.
